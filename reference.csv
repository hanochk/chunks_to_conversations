13815231,"Jennifer: I will have to give a presentation on global warming on Friday, and I am so nervous.
Mary: There are a lot of things you can do to make you feel more confident and less nervous.
Jennifer: What should I do, Mary?
Mary: First of all, you need to understand the subject matter thoroughly. You need to know what is global warming, what causes global warming, and what people should do to abate the effects of global warming.
Jennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.
Mary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.
Jennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?
Mary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third‚Ä¶
Jennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.
Mary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters‚Ä¶
Jennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet. I should not have any problems since the Internet has all kinds of data.
Mary: Good. It is easier to convince people and to hold their attention with actual data. It would be even better if you show some pictures along the way. Do you have any?
Jennifer: No, it is another thing to add to my To Do list. I guess I will need at least two or three pictures to persuade people about the dangers of global warming.
Mary: Pictures will keep your audience from being bored. In order for you to succeed, you need to keep them interested and involved.
Jennifer: What else do I need? Is there anything else I can do to help me relax and be at ease during my presentation?
Mary: You need to practice your presentation. Just pretend that you are standing in front of your audience and start to give your speech.
Jennifer: Pretending is one thing; actually giving a speech is another thing.
Mary: Think positive. Tell yourself that you can do it without any problems.
Jennifer: I guess I can look at this as a presentation of my point of view to my friends.
Mary: If you are really prepared, it will be a piece of cake. You will be able to speak with ease and confidence, and you will be amazed by how well you can express yourself.
Jennifer: I need to do this presentation really well. This is my first presentation in front of a big audience, and it is so important to me.
Mary: This is only the beginning, Jennifer. Being able to express your ideas with confidence and clarity is one of the best skills to possess.
Jennifer: You are absolutely right. I will take time to practice and to learn to relax and express myself really well. Wish me luck, Mary!
Mary: I know you. You can do it. Good luck, Jennifer!",Mary instructs Jennifer on how to prepare a presentation on global warming. Jennifer will give the presentation on Friday. It'll be her first with such a vast audience.

13728245,"Vera: Do you know any games that would work well during a get-together party?
Olga: That's an interesting question
Olga: Actually, I remember one we used to play in college
Olga: It's called 'Mafia'
Vera: Sounds intriguing :) Can you describe how it works more less, please?
Vera: I invited some colleagues from my new job and hope to spend this time in a relaxed atmosphere
Olga: Sure, I'll try
Olga: So... It all comes down to playing various roles
Olga: You need to prepare little notes with the following roles written on them: 'mafia' (2 or 3 such notes), 'mayor', 'policeman' and the rest will be 'residents'
Olga: Everyone picks a random note
Olga: The game is led by a preselected person, let's call him a leader. There are 2 parts of the game - night and day
Olga: All the players sleep at night, I mean everyone closes their eyes
Olga: The leader says which character should wake up. Mafia wakes up every night and eliminates one player
Olga: The next one to wake up is mayor who can save a chosen player from death, including himself
Olga: Then a policeman wakes up and have an option of checking up on a chosen player by asking the leader if that person is a mafia member
Olga: Remember that nobody says anything - you make gestures to communicate 
Olga: Are you with me, Vera? :D
Vera: Sure, ofc, it shapes up well! Keep going, please :)
Olga: Sweet :)
Olga: So... The night ends and it's daytime now. A person indicated (killed) by mafia is out of the game and the players discuss who can be a perp
Olga: This is the most important element of the game because here the fun begins. The city seek to eliminate mafia and the mafia's trying to kill the mayor or the residents
Olga: And now the last thing that I should mention - the worst mistake while playing the game is to hurry.
Olga: You need to have plenty of time for Mafia. And trust me, it's addictive ;)
Vera: Wow, Olga, this all sounds fantastic!!
Vera: I'm sure everybody will like it
Vera: How about you? That would be just awesome if you could join us :)
Olga: Hmm... When are you planning to meet?
Vera: Friday evening :)
Olga: Actually, why not. I'll be your tutor :)

Bea: He is doing great, thanks. He took a little while to settle but now he is loving it! How about Kai?
Ingrid: He is doing very well. He moved with about 8 kids from nursery so the change isn‚Äôt too big for him. I think he just felt he was moving up a level rather than changing schools. Does Ollie know anyone already?

Ingrid: Have school not got any other solutions? Surely they have seen this before?
Kelly: I have a meeting with them next week to discuss it again. I really hope they come up with some good ideas. I‚Äôm getting a bit desperate to be honest‚Ä¶
Bea: oh bless you I can imagine. Hopefully they can help him (and you)
Kelly: Thanks Bea, I might take you up on that offer though. I wouldn't give you Lucas to take to school, but could do with a break from Ellis!

Kristel: So first of all, how to make a group? When I try to do it on the room plan, it says I can book the maximum of 5 tickets.

Kristel: Okay, thank you, that‚Äôs clear. Another problem: when will I see the discount for groups?
Jake: You don‚Äôt have to do anything, after choosing a type and seats, the system will provide you with the amount to pay, showing how much it was discounted (depending on the number of people).
Kristel: What are the payment options?
Jake: Credit card, online transfer and PayPal.
Kristel: Which of them is the fastest?
Jake: PayPal of course, the longest is online transfer because it needs to be confirmed.
Kristel: Can I pay later, before the show?
Jake: The payment screen shows the amount and additionally the amount you need to pay to secure the places (it‚Äôs one third of the overall price).
Kristel: But you won‚Äôt charge me twice for this security part?
Jake: Of course not, it is deducted from the total amount.
Kristel: Great, what if one of the kids tries to enter with some snacks not bought in the cinema?
Jake: If we notice something like that, we will gently ask this person to leave it behind, and of course we will inform the counselors.

13829840,"Moira: Hello dear Barbie, greetings from Havana! I thought you might like a few pics of the city you'd told me so much about. My footnote to our talks about art deco:
Moira: <file_photo>
Moira: You can probably recognise these, as they are all in the centre of Havana. But I also found some fine examples of the style in the suburbs:
Moira: <file_photo>
Barbie: Hello dear! Thank you for the pics. Splendid as usual. I especially like your take of Hotel Nacional. At first I didn't recognise the zoomed tympana. They are gorgeous, aren't they?
Moira: I waited till late afternoon to get them. But they're  sort obvious, anyone can see them. I'm quite proud about my finds in the suburbs.
Moira: <file_photo>
Barbie: Indeed! Fantastic in design but in a horrific state of preservation, aren't they?
Moira: Some of them would be deemed uninhabitable in Europe but here they can house even a few families. That's post-Fidel Cuba for you!
Barbie: Politics aside they are supreme piece of architecture that should be taken care of. Any movement, initiative into this direction?
Moira: Not to my knowledge as far as the suburbs are concerned. The ones that are successful are active in the areas under the UNESCO World Heritage patronage.
Barbie: Have you been to Vedado? Seen villas there?
Moira: Yep. Fantastic. But wept over their condition. They really don't know what sort of treasures they have.
Barbie: I know! That ""remodelling"" should send them to prison, if you ask me. I photographed one shocking example of it and sent it to ""Architectural Review"" to be put on file. They were quite obliging, I must say.
Barbie: <file_photo>
Barbie: How did you discover these houses in the suburbs!?
Moira: By accident. I went on a tour of the city in an open-top bus and had a glimpse of some from the top deck. Took snaps with their GPS location and came back. By taxi.
Barbie: Splendid!!! If you have some more or less complete series of photos of singular objects with their GPS, we can assemble a portfolio and submit it to ""Architectural Review"". They are usually not only pleased but also pay for valuable contributions.
Moira: I would be flattered! I'll show you what I've got when I'm back home.
Barbie: Which is?
Moira: End of January.
Barbie: Looking forward to our meeting then.
Moira: Me too! Thanks for your suggestion.
Barbie: Pleasure. So good luck and keep photographing.
Moira: I can't stop!
Barbie: :-)

13731415,"Stephanie: What do you think of what's happening in the UK Parliament today?
Fred: You mean the resignations of four high-ranking ministers over the Brexit deal?
Stephanie: Yes.
Fred: Well, I don't think this deal is going to get signed. Apart from anything else it is worse than simply taking a second vote and hopefully being able to withdraw from Article 50 notice.
Stephanie: Can we even withdraw now?
Fred: Apparently we can do that. There are some opinions that say not, but in reality it would be a big relief to the other countries. 
Fred: The alternative, having no deal at all, is not only risky for the UK, but could cause big trouble to the rest of the states and of course there are quite big issues in the Eurozone already. This could tip over a very big landslide.
Stephanie: So you think we could get a better deal if we hold out?
Fred: Right now the optimal strategy would be to stay inside the EU, forget about leaving as we did not know the hurdles that would be placed by the powers that be. We need to work today with other Eurosceptic countries like Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and the other ex-Warsaw Pact countries.
Stephanie: To do what?
Fred: To change the EU into what we actually want it to be. To radically alter it so that it becomes what we hoped it was going to be.
Stephanie: Can that be done?
Fred: We see that the Germans have had enough of Merkel. When she goes, Macron also goes. It wouldn't take more than one of those bigger countries going the way of Italy, or a few more of the secondary states like Holland and Denmark, from the western side, to start a programme of deep change.
Stephanie: Makes sense. IN the end we all need to have some kind of co-operation in Europe.
Fred: Every Brexiteer I spoke to actually wants A European Union, they just don't want THIS European Union.
Stephanie: But is there any chance that there will be a second vote.
Fred: May has said no, but May could be finished in a week from now. If there is a General Election and all the Conservatives stand on a revote platform with UKIP and Labour saying no re-vote, then the Tories may well win. Then they would have to offer a re-vote.
Stephanie: What if we then end up staying in but other countries start defaulting and leaving us picking up the bills which was going to maybe happen to France and Germany?
Fred: That's the downside risk. Certainly if we are ever going to leave, the time to do it is now, or stay and fight for a different kind of Union which might not need countries to go crashing out of it that way. 
Stephanie: I don't know if you will every find a format that 30 countries will be able to agree on. 
Fred: Either you have to make it so that there is really not that much that they have to agree on, or you make everything so harmonised that it is really one country and everyone is unhappy with something. Where we are now is stuck in the middle, trying to agree and enforce too much, but still with options for countries to do things differently and to look after themselves. We haven't managed to deliver the European dream.",Fred would like Great Britain to stay in the European Union but according to him the EU should evolve. Stephanie is sceptic if it's possible to find a solution on which 30 countries would agree.

My sister had just taken a bad fall in the bathroom hitting her L lower rib cage against an edge of a bathtub and is experiencing general pain. She doesn't think she's broken anything. Would you think it might be something demanding medical attention?
Peter: Good evening Tim, I'm still in bed reading, Emma is asleep, so I'll stick to writing. Firstly, sorry to hear that but don't worry. If she can still move and talk, it can't be too bad. She doesn't spit blood, does she?
Tim: No.
Peter: Is the impacted area swollen?
Tim: No.
Peter: BTW when did it happen?
Tim: Not more than an hour ago.
Peter: Is she alone? Sorry I mean immediate help if her condition deteriorated.
Tim: She lives alone. Her next door neighbours are just across the yard but I don't think they would be much help, being old themselves.
Peter: Do you think she'll be capable of phoning in case of an urgent need?
Tim: I should think so. Well, she texted me after the accident.
Peter: While you talked to her, was she lucid?
Tim: We couldn't talk because of my wife and the baby in the same room. She also preferred to write, since, as I suppose, it was less painful that talking. And yes ‚Äì she was absolutely lucid.
Peter: Of course I cannot say anything definite without examining her but judging by the symptoms you've described I'd tend to say that it's just soreness due to the impact of the fall. But she has to observe her body.
Tim: Exactly what I told her! Should she see a doctor?
Peter: She might if she feels worse. What she may need, however, are painkillers. Tell your sister not to hesitate to take painkillers. Even strong ones. For that she may need a prescription.
Tim: Will they advise me at the drugstore when I describe the case? Anything over the counter?
Peter: If you're going to get them for her, take IBU-ratiopharm 400 g, 20 pills, and 10 pills of the same but 600 g. She may want to start with the stronger one.
Peter: Yes, they're available over the counter.
Tim: It's so generous of you to let me have all this advice at this late hour. I really appreciate it, Peter. Thank you very much.
Peter: Really nothing to thank for. Glad I could help. Let me know how she's doing.
Tim: I will. Thank you again. And good night.

Vince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away.
Kyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.
Megan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P
Roseanne: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty.

Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.
Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D
Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.
Kyle: Do they pay him? :P
Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?

13819864,"Oliver: I think I should stop reading the rules after we already played a game
Oliver: found two things we were doing wrong today
Chris: maybe it shows that you should keep reading them
Chris: so what we were doing wrong?
Oliver: first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule :P)
Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to
Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
Chris: had no idea about the second one
Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse
Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again
Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
Emily: true
Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;)
Oliver: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote
Chris: makes sense
Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings
Oliver: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income
Chris: right
Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again
Emily: we can always do it during the next meeting
Oliver: as usual I'm up for anything
Oliver: but if we'll play a new game, let me read the rules first :P",Oliver found out that they misunderstood the rules of the game. Emily and Chris think they should play the game again.

Keith: hmm, yeah, but the charger itself should be the same. so if you use your cable with her charger, you could see if it works?
Keith: then at least you'll know which part needs replacing
Amanda: oh, I could do that, yeah
Amanda: should I get the spare part from apple or...?
Keith: idk, I've never had an iphone. I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work... their prices are too high

Fran: There's nothing wrong with you. Don't let yourself think that. Maybe you just need more time
Sally: It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself
Fran: Definitely not. But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it
Sally: I just don't understand it. And myself
Fran: You don't have to understand anything :)
Sally: I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back
Fran: You probably started thinking too much ;)
Sally: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy
Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;)
Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all
Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;)
Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk
Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once
Sally: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all
Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. 
Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things
Fran: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;)
Sally: You're probably right.",Sally doesn't feel the chemistry in her new relationship anymore. Fran suggests that Sally is overthinking the situation and that Sally should give the relationship some time.

13715835,"Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea?
Ron: I might be lacking the context here
Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example
Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year.
Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.
Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility
Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?
Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.
Jessie: so what do we get from it really?
Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.
Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>
Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association
Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually
Michaela: I recall two as well
Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.
Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours
Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding
Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association
Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work
Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly
Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it
Michaela: Steve?
Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now

Leu: That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time.
Luisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.
Leu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.
Luisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.
Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?
Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!
Leu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.
Luisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.
Leu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.
Luisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.
Leu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?
Luisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.
Leu: Therapy?
Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.
Leu: Nor can I.
Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.
Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.
Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...
Leu: Right you are! ""The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different."" Do you remember?

13716430,"Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? 
Max: <link_video>
Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn‚Äôt watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)
Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well.
Daniel: Short attention span üòä
Max: Daniel probably from pot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco.
Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don‚Äôt believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.

Virginia: MJ users will not believe anything bad. They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard!",Max and his friends watched the video about cannabis.

13728509,"Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!üòç
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.

Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
Vic: What do u mean?
Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.

Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online.

Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
Noah: OK.
Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.

13731166,"Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. 
Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?
Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday.

Josie: Ciao, Stefano!
Stefano: So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it?
Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy.
Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P
Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.
Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.
Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?
Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.
Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.
Stefano: Really? What did he say?
Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game.
Stefano: What? Rotfl!
Josie: That's what Salman said...
Stefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum...
Josie: De gustiBus!
Stefano: I know, it was a typo!

Stefano: Hahaha.

Bobby: They may well be, but not for my wallet!
Mickey: What do u mean?
Bobby: I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on.
Mickey: And what of it?
Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses!
Mickey: What? Are u sure?
Bobby: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. 
Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
Mickey: That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 
Bobby: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. 
Mickey: All right, this is quite serious.
Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
Mickey: What?
Bobby: That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products!

Bobby: Absolutely!
Mickey: How long do u think they've been lying to us?
Bobby: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
