Sophie: Robert let me know we you condiser to be a part of helping these women you mention.
Sophie: She monetized the death of her husband by writing a book. She acted like she knew everything about grief and went from talk show to talk show promoting her book but never gave it to those who are grieving.
Sophie: There is little honest and altruistic about her. She has enough money but never thought about giving out the book to those men and women who suffered the same.
Robert: Sophie Why would they want to read it?
Msty:  Never liked her something I did not know what
Gerard:  Greed and power over any level of ethical constraints.
Michelle: Ah the old anti-semite slander.. it's rife in the UK too. Many ppl see right through this desperate deflection tactic.
Violet:  There’s a new “ism” in town. Fearism. Fear of loosing wealth, status, respect, belief system, etc. - resulting in poor and dangerous decision making by the Fearist - membership includes both men and women.
Caroline: Time for her to lean out.
Msty: Female work bully or Devil wear Prada
Carole: This is everything that’s wrong with White Feminism hat is a racist comment.
Beth: (((White)))
Carole: Beth bore off! I’m referring to ‘white feminists’ and their blindness to structural issues.
Richard: Says the white person getting offended on behalf of other people
Julie : Corporate is as corporate does.
Gerard: the lack of integrity is front and center and don't leave out zuck either
Mark: sounds just like our very own tory party
Msty: What rubbish
Msty: <file_other>
Caroline: What if women are much like men?

Ann: But I could basically anything
Tony: I feel I'm too old for that, but I envy you a bit
Ann: But you've done it already, with Paris I think
Tony: Yes, but it was in my 30s

Daniel: Discworld series?
Jeff: Yep.
Daniel: So what do you want to know?
Jeff: There's so many of them that I don't know where to start!
Daniel: I know it might not be the most useful advice but I would start at the beginning :P
Jeff: Very funny...
Daniel: I'm serious.
Daniel: There are lots of ""recommended"" patterns when dealing with Discworld series.
Daniel: But for me the answer is simple.
Daniel: Just start with the first book and follow the order in which they were released.
Jeff: So why people recommend a different approach?
Daniel: There are many sub-series within Discworld.
Daniel: Rincewind, Witches, City Watch, Death and so on.
Daniel: Some prefer to read it that way to focus on one set of characters.
Jeff: Okay but you still think I should read everything in order?
Daniel: That is what I did.
Daniel: Especially that there are characters that appear across several series.
Daniel: So that way you won't miss anything.
Jeff: Oh now I get it.
Jeff: I'll just follow your advice.
Daniel: No problem.

Ashton: most of the times it's blown out of proportions
Lucas: so what happened?
Lucas: I'm not really up to speed
Ashton: Magic held a press meeting and told the reporters that Simmons contacted him for potential mentoring next summer
Lucas: that's it?
Ashton: well apparently Philly's GM didn't allow it and now NBA is investigating
Lucas: does seem like it's blown out of proportions like you said
Ashton: they probably still have all the drama with George and Davis in mind
Ashton: and are playing it safe
Lucas: if that continues Magic won't be able to talk to anyone outside the Lakers organization
Ashton: maybe it would be safer for him this way
Ashton: I don't think other franchises are happy with him and James' agent getting involved with all this
Lucas: I'm sure it happens with other GMs as well
Lucas: they're just not under such a scrutiny
Ashton: that's what you get when you're Magic
Ashton: too bad it doesn't help the team
Ashton: this season is pretty disappointing

13815005,"Tom: Good afternoon. I have received your contact details from my colleague Anna.
Diana: Hello Tom, it's good to hear from you. Anna told me you will be in touch. How can I help you?
Tom: Actually, there are two things. First of all, my wife and I are looking for a flat. At the same time we want to sell our old flat.
Diana: I understand. Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?
Tom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?
Diana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.
Tom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.
Diana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.
Tom: Thank you! This is a great advice!
Tom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.
Diana: How many rooms are you looking for?
Tom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.
Diana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?
Tom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.
Diana: Thank you. What's your current budget?
Tom: We were thinking about £400 000. Would it be possible?
Diana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?
Tom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.
Diana: How much are you aiming for?
Tom: At least £300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.
Diana: Could you please send me some pictures? I would also gladly make an appointment with you.
Tom: That would be perfect!
Diana: Would Monday at 8 be acceptable?
Tom: Hm, I need to consult it with my wife, but so far it's all right."
13812325,"Quentin: Are you coming to the unboxing tonight? 
Tarquin: Have you had another delivery, then.
Quentin: Yes indeed. And as usual I have no idea what they have sent me.
Tarquin: Did you make an event on Facebook?
Quentin: Yes I did. You didn't see it?
Tarquin: I haven't been on for a few days. Actually I got a ban for making a joke which offended someone. It involved a penguin, which as you know can be a very offensive topic.
Quentin: I don't know. People today as so sensitive, but are ignorant anyway.
Tarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing? 
Quentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm
Tarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up. 
Quentin: Great.
Tarquin: How many books do you think there will be?
Quentin: About 200, like the other time.
Tarquin: how many did you sell on the spot? 
Quentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.
Tarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. 
Quentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.
Tarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?
Quentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.
Tarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?
Quentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.
Tarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.
Quentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.
Tarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?
Quentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special ""Quentin price"" only on the evening of the unboxing. I'll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise."

Ruth: yeah, it’s just different comparing to gas
Christian: gas, absolutely without a question- nothing else gives you the control!
Nick: I’m definitely more interested in a controllable consistent heat
Mary: with induction it’s like on and off so you have to regulate temperature.. 
Kate: induction- yes, gas- no cause it takes ages to boil water!
Tim: you can always use an electric kettle you know?
Kate: haha! Not funny!
Kate: it’s easier to clean as well.

Amy: Fine you convinced me. I’ll give it a go! Do I need a mat?
Ann: They’ll give you one or I can borrow you one of mine I’ve got two.
Amy: I’d rather borrow one from you ha ha! So when’s your next classes?
Ann: Thursday at 6.
Amy: In the evening i hope?!
Ann: Yeah don’t worry. They’ve got classes in the morning but i can’t force myself to get up so early. 
Amy: Neither do i. So evening practice it is.
Ann: You won’t regret it. I’ll bring the mats. Just put on some comfy clothes.
Amy: a pair of leggings and a t-shirt will do? 
Ann: definitely! Whatever you feel comfy in. I wear harem pants and a loose fitting long sleeved top.
Amy: Ok. See you on Thursday then!

Gillian: But it looks great on her!
Carol: And it's totally awesome!
Jane: It does and it is ;) But that wasn't the point of Maggie's question, was it?
Margaret: Right. I mean, I already love this dress, but I don't want to look like a slut. My boss and his wife are going to be there. Maybe I should just save it for our New Year's Eve party?
Jane: Might be a good idea ;)
Gillian: Come on, she doesn't look like a slut!
Jane: Hey, I never said she does! 
Carol: Girls, I think Jane might have a point. If my husband's assistant came looking like THAT, I'd be jealous as hell :P
Margaret: LOL, I'll take that as a compliment.
Carol: XDDD But seriously, if you want to get promoted, better don't make that woman angry by looking better than her.
Gillian: Okay, how about that green dress we bought together last month? It really brings out your eyes.

Jenny: So, no good suggesting a drink one night?

Anne: Thanks a lot! I was thinking about Angelo's as well, but it happens that my cousin is Italian so I think it may be a bit risky to impress him with an Italian restaurant ;)
Carl: Fair point. What about Toff's? They are famous for having the best fish and chips in the UK.
Anne: Haven't heard about them! Where are they?
Carl: Third zone, near Highgate. The area is beautiful, really worth going, especially if someone's never been to London.
Sarah: If you're looking for something more central, I highly recommend Yori. It's a Korean restaurant, a true gem <3
Anne: What are the prices? It's not that we are really on a budget here, but wouldn't mind saving some for more touristic stuff ;)
Sarah: Cool, I find Yori affordable and their prive-value is really high in my opinion.
Carl: Same for the Toff's, they mainly sell fish and fish and chips, so maybe check with your cousin if he likes it first.
Anna: Oh, I bet he'd love to have an Instagram worthy photo with a fish and chips in London, hahaha!
Tom: If I were you, I'd focus on the bars more ;) Take him to Soho, skip the fancy ones though.
Anna: That goes without a question! Have a few places in mind already. He also has a sweet tooth, so I was thinking maybe Hummingbird?
Sarah: I think I may be joining you for that one! If not, take the salted caramel for my sake.

Aida:?!
Nestor: I’ve only got one A this year… Professors mostly refuse to give better grades than a B here :(
Aida: Fuckers. Sounds like the French system. Only the professor merits an A
Nestor: Something like that, actually our education system is very similar
Nestor: But I didn’t even want to talk about uni!!
Aida: Ooops 🤫
Aida: On a different note… I’m polishing my Portuguese listening to Ludmilla, do you know her? 🤣
Nestor: lol yeah
Nestor: They usually play her songs at parties, etc.
Nestor: But I don’t listen to her myself
Aida: Such a shame. I can’t stop singing “Hoje”. A smashing hit 🥁💥

Misty: unfortunately the majority of these people don't even understand the slogans and quotes they're chanting
Ben: yeah...a bald guy chanting ""God, Honor, Homeland"" who probably doesn't even go to church on Sunday
Rebecca: I'd never take part in such a thing, it's too dangerous, how is it even possible for these people to see anything if they're walking through the red smoke????????
Ben: well, they're going in one direction so maybe they just don't give a fuck and move forward
Rebecca: probably...
Misty: I'm curious how many people this year will be injured after this march is over...they sometimes trample each other hairlessly
Ben: I hope that nobody. But as we all know the truth is different...we will see

Pat: Bit personal, dear! No, we retired from the pub 10 years ago, mid-60s, me and Jon have had a ball, cruises, safaris and I've seen my sister in Oz and my brother in Thailand several times.
Sandra: Oh Pat, that sounds lovely! My husband's still working, but we're planning a special trip to the US in a year or two. Can't wait! He's 66, and has had enough!
Pat: So, apart from Bren, you found any others?
Sandra: There was Betty Davies, but she was about 60 when the factory closed in 94, long time ago, if she's alive, I don't suppose she's on Facebook at 84 or something!
Pat: No, I suppose not, but you never know! I heard Marigold had passed away, you know, the supervisor?
Sandra: Yes, very sad, not long after Lister's closed, I think.
Pat: Ok, what about that young girl who loved David Bowie, joined us in about 73, only about 16 she was, I think. She always tried to match his current look, you remember when she did Ziggy Stardust with ginger hair and no eyebrows!
Sandra: Oh yes, Amanda Johnson, she was even younger than me and Brenda! She's still over 60 now though! She may well be on Facebook, did she get married, do you remember?
Pat: Not sure, could be tricky tracking all these down, so many common names!
Sandra: Oh yes, Magda Zielinski was in our section too! Maybe an easier name to find. Her mum was Polish, I think.
Pat: Oh yes, Magda, what a beauty! She was like one of the girls from Charlie's Angels, the blonde one.
Sandra: Yes, Farrah Fawcett, with the lovely hairstyle! I think Magda should have been a model, not a machinist!
Pat: Well, Sand, lovely to hear from you, please keep in touch about the reunion, or just for a chat! Bye!
Sandra: OK, Pat, hope to see you again, bye!"

Michelle: How disgusting! I would just go to a doctor honestly
Adrien: No, if you don't have fever and no symptoms nobody will give you an antibiotic 
Caroline: exactly, so what should I do?

Caroline: That's the plan
Michelle: but would it not be better to just go to a doctor?
Adrien: I think there is no need for that at the moment

John: I know that there are some clever, religious individuals. But statistically religious people are stupid.

John: But most of academics are not religious.
Tyre: How do you know it?
John: Experience but also some data I've seen.
Tyre: It's just not true.
John: They are mostly people believing in things that have nothing to do with logic or reason: miracles, ghosts, witchcraft, just as our neighbour.
Tyre: I think it's only one part of them. There are theologians, people who actually know a lot about philosophy, logic etc.
John: Yes, there are also people doing ""scientifically"" tarot, horoscopes and astrology.
Tyre: You can't compare these things.
John: Sure I can, they are unfalsifiable things. You cannot prove any claim.
Tyre: Because religion is from a different sphere, the sphere of faith.
John: So is tarot!
Tyre: Whatever! What about the neighbour?
John: She stopped me in the staircase and I had to listen for 15 minutes about some miracles somewhere. Like god telling her something through some signs.

Alice: Sure, I get it. I just know that my baby shower gift turned out not to be very useful in a long term.

Vincent: What do you mean by proper job?
Victor: A job where I could have an opportunity to exploit my abilities but not where the employer will exploit me.
Vincent: Why didn't you join a Government department?
Victor: The first thing is that Government has limited jobs to offer because of the world wide economic recession. The second thing is that in the Government departments both the idle and the ideal are treated in the same manner. The idle ones have no fear to be deprived of their jobs while the ideal have no hope for any rapid progress.
Vincent: Victor your CV shows that you have been a very bright student throughout your academic career. You have won many distinctions and have visited a number of countries. If you think you can't make any progress in Pakistan why don't you try your luck in  another country, let's say in America or England.

Greg: so we should be happy if we get him
Steven: but at what cost?
Steven: from what I read they prepared to give up almost everything for him
Greg: he's a superstar
Greg: I don't think they'll let him go for close to nothing
Steven: I know but that's not the point
Steven: we'll end up with LeBron, Davis and some subpar roleplayers/vets
Greg: Magic should know what he's doing
Steven: not so sure about that
Steven: giving up Lonzo, Kuzma, Zubac and Ingram plus some picks just to get Davis seems a bit too much
Greg: with both LeBron and Davis we should be able to attract more roleplayers and maybe a third superstar during free agency
Steven: I hope you're right
Steven: sometimes I have a feeling that people forget that you still play basketball with 5 players on the court not 2
Steven: no matter how good they are
Greg: maybe but it's something beyond our control
Greg: and having both Davis and James on the team would put us back in contention
Greg: no matter how good LeBron is he won't win by himself
Steven: maybe
Steven: but I liked how they were developing young players
Steven: it would be sad to see almost all of them gone in just one trade
Greg: the trade still didn't happen so at the moment is pure speculation

Tonia: All the very best to you, dear Carol and Charles, in 2019!
Carol: Thank you my Dear :* :*
Carol: How are you? Enjoying Cuba?
Tonia: The country is a bit tough. Very poor, hard living conditions. So the stay here is a bit too long for my liking.
Carol: And what does Mark say? He'd been to Cuba before, hadn't he?
Tonia: Yes, some 20 years ago! No comparison. He says it's much worse now. But he seems to enjoy every moment of our stay. Maybe with the exception of loud music all the time.
Carol: Do they party every night?! Is it live music?
Tonia: Everything! In Cuba nobody cares about such nonsense as night rest of the neighbours. It is noisy, and I mean NOISY, at all hours. People, cars, children, music, dogs...
Carol: That sounds exactly like our black folk here!!
Carol: It must be difficult when you plan your trips to predict a perfect length of a stay in one place. Which town was so bad?
Tonia: Havana Vieja. Add to the noise a narrow street, windows that can't be closed and the proximity to a major thoroughfare.
Carol: I got it! Like in a township.
Tonia: Are they so noisy? Can't remember really. Or, truth to tell, was never in any of them but only driving thru.
Carol: My domestic helper, who is black and obviously lives in a township, is always complaining that she can't sleep from the partying in her neighbourhood.
Tonia: When it gets bad, I take my earplugs and Mark another drink ;-)) Nothing more one can do!
Tonia: How is Charles? Is his operation in a week's time or so?
Carol: He's doing well, thank you. It's on the 23rd and he's not looking forward to it. But we are coping!
Tonia: Poor Charlie! Is he afraid of pain? Or of the complete anesthetics? Or complications?
Carol: A combination of them all, I guess. But he doesn't talk much about it and I don't insist.
Tonia: Right. Mark will be getting his op in mid February. Too early to even start being apprehensive.
Carol: You two just enjoy your holidays and make the most of it!
Tonia: Sure! After all it is Caribbean!

Peggy: Ok, that’s fine 🙄
Peggy: Maria is looking for a logistician to help her with conducting the workshops for parents on Saturday (10am-5pm). We would be forced to cancel the meeting, if none of you could participate.
Jada: I have my own workshops this Saturday 😒.
Tim: What would I need to do?
Peggy: Bring stuff, take it back, look after the participants. As always.
Tim: I’m going with my kid to the cinema. It’s her birthday. But I’ll ask Mark 😉.
Raphael: Where is it?
Peggy: Your school.
Raphael: Really 😱😱😱?
Tim: Oh, Raphael. You’re the host, you should be a logistician 😅.
Peggy: I’m surprised you didn’t know. You work in one team with Maria 😕.
Peggy: I don’t understand why you avoid talking to each other.
Raphael: She can do it herself 😒. I don’t understand why she needs a logistician.
Peggy: Ask her, not me 😒.
Raphael: Ok, I have workshops as well – I’m meeting with my new team members, and I have to explain them how the CRM works.

Carlos: With you.
Nancy: You are impossible!

Nancy: Not really. Have to swot for the test on Friday. I must also sort out some things at home. And I have to go and see uncle Tom, it's his birthday.
Carlos: Can't we visit him together?
Nancy: Good lord! He would get a heart attack!
Carlos: Why? You always say I'm very presentable.
Nancy: Of course you are. For me you're the most attractive male in the universe.
Carlos: The thing with uncle Tom... Has it something to do with me being Mexican?
Nancy: Don't forget that uncle Tom is a staunch WASP.
Carlos: That IS ridiculous! We aren't in the 19th century. Not even in the 20th!
Nancy: I know but that's the way he is. He can't imagine that his favorite niece could be paired with anyone but a respectable WASP.
Carlos: Well then. Are you trying to tell me that because of him we will never be able to get married and have a family together?
Nancy: Look. We don't have to discuss it like that. We'll talk when we meet. Right?
Carlos: So why are you meeting me if not with the prospect of having a family with me one day?
Nancy: We just have fun together. We like each other. We both like similar things.
Carlos: Like sex?
Nancy: Yes. You're the best lover I've ever had.

Clark: Yes and no. It's not that simple. People will be talking different things.
Kate: Hey! I don't give a fuck what they are saying. Let them talk. I'm more interested in your version of events.
Clark: My version? I don't even know where to start. There was this old bugger, my health issues, some fits of depression. Maybe I'm just burnt-out. I just want a change.

Clark: Thanks, Kate. 
Kate: :-)
Clark: I'll be fine. I've already done some re-thinking.

Clark: We?
Kate: Well, there's me, Gina, Tom...there are a few black sheep in this 'corporate family'.
Clark: Yeah... the 'corporate family' with the big daddy. I'm really sick of his 'committment to duties'.
Kate: Me too :-( 
Clark: You cannot teach an old dog new tricks.
Kate: Come to think of that now I don't know if I'm more sorry for you or for me because I must stay here. 
Clark: Why?
Kate: Primo, I'm not as outspoken as you. I can't stand my ground like you. So probably, I'll be stuck in this hell... like... forever?
Clark: Don't make a hero of me.
Kate: Secundo, with the mortgage that we took last year and the kids... No, I can't risk that much.

Rob: I can't remember anything. Panel blackout! ⚫
Hugh: Any annoying questions from the audience?
Rob: ⚫
Hugh: lol
Clarice: Well, I don't know what the guys think but I personally think the guy who chaired Rob's panel was a little bit of a dickhead, wasn't he?
Rob: 🔴 Yeah, a total dick. He did a nice round-up at the end in which he scoffed at our papers and basically said we were a bunch of silly losers. After which he asked us to provide a definition of politics, just to make sure we even understood what it was.
Clarice: @Hugh for your information, Rob is exaggerating less than usual
Hugh: Fuck, sounds insane
Juan: It was. But I actually had a very good time. Rob was the last one to answer the ""question"" and he gave a truly moving performance -of scorn and intellectual superiority 💖
Hugh: Ha ha ha how so
Clarice: Well, I don't wish to interrupt but I think it's not without importance that Rob actually began his answer by laughing the chair in his face
Juan: Sounds like a nice prelude 🎼
Rob: Indeed, that bit I really forgot lol. Anyway, I told him that as he has asked such a big question I was going to answer a few more. So I defined not only politics but also History, Art and Literature 😂😂😂😂
Clarice: And the best thing was that the guy actually seemed to enjoy the answer, even though it was apparent that Rob was mocking him from beginning to end. So weird...
Rob: I agree with Clarice, he looked me in the eye all the while, nodding with approval
Juan: Sounds really bizarre... So Rob, what's History? What's Literature? What's Art?
Rob: Oh fuck off lol
Clarice: You can purchase advance tickets for Rob for 10 EUR; tickets at the entrance cost 12 EUR
Rob: 😂😂😂
Juan: Rob sure deserves a glass of wine tonight

Ian: I asked her to marry me. Not a real marriage, but just to preserve my rights in Italy after Brexit.
Olivier: I see.
Ian: As you can imagine, she refused.
Olivier: I am sorry. But why actually?
Ian: Hard to say. There is no need to be angry, no is no, she has the right to say no.
Olivier: yes, she does...
Ian: I think she is generally panicked, like afraid of the divorce proceedings and she doesn't feel entirely entitled since she believes to be ""a fake Italian"".
Olivier: Because she was born in Romania?
Ian: Exactly. It's completely ridiculous, before going to the US she even called the embassy to ask if the same procedure applies to her as ""a fake Italian"". She thinks to be a kind of a second class citizen.
Olivier: Quite stupid.
Ian: Very!
Olivier: But this is how it is.
Ian: She talked some rubbish afterwards, like we have to try other options etc., see what is possible.
Olivier: Are there any other options?
Ian: All of them are more complicated, if there are any at all. 
Olivier: I see.
Ian: But the truth is that I feel alone now with my problems, that I cannot rely on her.

Martha: Look, do you really want your daughter to look like a tiny drag queen?
Sara: Ok, this is horrible, fair enough, but maybe a little bit?

Paula: Why is that?
Joanna: He said there's something wrong with my back.
Paula: That doesn't necessary mean you need to stop doing yoga.
Joanna: Well, that's what he said. I'm not a doctor.
Paula: But does he know what kind of yoga you do?
Joanna: Hahaha, like he cares
Paula: See? Btw, what kind of yoga you do actually? :D
Joanna: I tried different, but now I'm going to ashtanga classes.
Paula: Hm... It is quite strenuous.
Joanna: So what do you suggest?
Paula: I don't know what's wrong with your back, but I'd rather go for sivananda.
Joanna: I tried it at the beginning, but I found it boring to be honest...
Paula: Not if you have a good teacher.
Joanna: Could you recommend me someone then?
Paula: Of course I can! With pleasure!
Paula: I go to Lotus studio, call them and ask for classes with Tina. She's amazing.
Joanna: Thank you! I love doing yoga, I was feeling really bummed out when the doctor told me to quit.
Paula: I don't think that you have to. Maybe you could bring all your medical files to consult?
Joanna: Is this possible?
Paula: There's one therapist, you know, just in case someone's injured. He can have a look and advise you which exercise you can do and which to avoid.
Joanna: That'd be wonderful!"

13819583,"Agnes: Heyyy. Just a quick question… So I was wondering what to read for the next seminar… I think I won’t have the time to read everything so perhaps you could give me suggestions? 🙏🏼
Donna: Hey Agnes
Donna: Yep, sure. I haven’t read everything just yet but I’d say read Gary Cross, “Kid’s Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood”
Donna: I think it’s interesting and also gives you a nice overview of the subject (which is what you desire 🔥 if you’re not planning on reading everything)
Keith: Yeah, that one is good. I’d also say read Regan
Keith: The titles goes along the lines of “War Toys, Movies … & Militarization”
Keith: It’s in the bibliography Mary gave us
Tim: It’s “War Toys, War Movies, and the Militarization of the United States”
Tim: by Reagan, R.
Keith: Oh wait… WAT??? 😹😹😹
Tim: 🤣🤣🤣
Donna: How confusing 😂
Agnes: I’ll remember the title and the author
Agnes: Forever
Agnes: Any other suggestions?
Tim: Well, it would be an obvious choice to read a couple of chapter from Mary’s book
Keith: It’s titled “Wounding Mars”
Keith: Or was it “Wounding Venus”?
Agnes: LOOOOL
Agnes: Guys this was an innocent question about readings for a seminar in cultural history, you can’t be treating me like this. I’m an adult student, I have a job, I have yet another job, I have a child
Agnes: Lots of them actually 👶🏽👶🏽👶🏽👶🏽👶🏽
Agnes: And I can’t read your JOKES for the seminar!!!!
Agnes: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Agnes: To be fair I remember that one, it’s Wounding the World, right?
Keith: Yes 🤗 Catchy title, isn’t it?
Agnes: Yeah, I was actually thinking about it and thought that the initial Ws are supposed to make us think of World Wars
Tim: Yeah, that makes sense. Never thought about it
Donna: We can ask her
Agnes: Tim and Keith are in splendid shape, I think they should do it
Tim: I will ✨"

Martha: I guess I can. I am done with my homework. What did mom want you to buy?
Laura: Well, she wanted me to buy enough groceries for the whole week. Besides meat, some fish and vegetables, we can buy whatever else we want for snacks and breakfast.
Martha: What do you want for breakfast?
Laura: I guess some cereal as usual.
Martha: I do not want cereal every day. I will buy some pancakes and syrup then.
Laura: Get the new Fine Food pancakes in the frozen food section please. I want to see how it tastes.
Martha: Do we still have enough coffee and cream for mom and dad?
Laura: Yes, we do. Talking about coffee and cream, you better buy some milk also. We almost ran out of it.
Martha: Next, what do you want for snacks?
Laura: Some chips would be fine with me. You probably want your chocolate cookies.
Laura:  As far as meat, mom wants some pork and some chicken.
Martha: Just any kind of pork?
Laura: I forgot to ask mom about that. Anyways, you can ask the butcher for his opinion. He knows what is best.
Martha: How about fish?
Laura: Mom wants some salmon and some catfish. Make sure that they are fresh.
Martha: How much salmon and catfish should I buy?
Laura: Oh, buy four pieces of salmon filet and four pieces of catfish filet. Mom does not like to get the whole fish.
Martha: Are these fish filets sold by weight or by the piece?
Laura: I am not very sure. Just buy four decent sized pieces. Not too big and not too small."

Lea: There were a couple of them, the trip was truly amazing, pity you couldn't make it :(
Zack: I told you already - next time. What did you like the most?
Lea: Hm... Grand Canyon I think. Although it was as I'd thought - I enjoyed the road, people and bars the most. It was really cool to see the real America.
Zack: Did you bring any gifts?
Lea: I did, a few, and don't worry - I have your newest Vouge straight from New York ;)
Zack: Ha, thumbs up for you! <3
Zack: How was travelling with Ana and Patrick?
Lea: It was all right, we got along quite fine. Patrick was a bit whiny at the beginning, but then he probably noticed he didn't have an audience.
Zack: Hahaha, I can imagine it
Lea: In the end it was quite funny: weather too hot or too dry or too cold, people too loud, too obnoxious, too weird, food too fat, too expensive, weirdly cheap... :D
Zack: Oh my god, you should receive a medal of honour for this :D
Lea: He came around eventually (thankfully!)

Rodney: A music shop? Cool. You mean like instruments and not CDs, right?
Jim: Yeah :) No one buys CDs anymore!
Rodney: I knew that. How about your classes? Are you falling behind or keeping up? :)
Jim: Most of my classes are ok. I'm falling a little behind in my Biology class, but that's because I was sick last week. For the most part I'm pretty proud of myself :)
Rodney: Sounds good.
Jim: Our professor for Creative writing is really cool! He's written some fiction books. Maybe you've heard of him. His name's Caleb Risztardt.
Rodney: No, but I'll check it out on Amazon, and maybe download a sample.
Jim: His classes are always fun, and plus you know I like writing, so it's a chance for me to transcribe some of my creativity onto paper. It will definitely spur my songwriting abilities forward.
Rodney: That's good to hear! It's always easier to learn something if you like it. Are you still living with Tracy and Frank?
Jim: Yeah, but it's getting harder for us to get along.
Rodney: What do you mean? 
Jim: You know how I'm such a soft sleeper. They come home very late on the weekends and wake me up. Sometimes they even go out during the week and come home late. I mean, sometimes I go along with them, but lately it's getting to be a little too much.
Rodney: Maybe you should mention something.
Jim: Maybe I should, but I don't want to start an argument.
Rodney: I understand, but I'm sure there's a delicate way of saying it.
Jim: I'll think of something, but if my eyes start closing during lectures, I'll definitely let them know how I feel.
Rodney: Maybe I'll come visit you next month. Do you think there would be room for me for like 2 nights?
Jim: Yeah, we can always make room. You know you're always welcome :)

James: Ok
Jenny: As for the layout, you have some cool experience and I think the way its presented doesn't give you justice. Netflix is an entertainment company so maybe make it more entertaining? ;) You can use different colours, graphs, make it more visual, not only informative.
James: Cool, never thought about it!

Jenny: But yeah, I think it's a cool place to work at. My team is absolutely brilliant, people are motivated, inspiring, so I really couldn't ask for more.
James: Do you know then anyone from the business team? It almost sounds to good to be true :)
Jenny: I know a few, they're a nice bunch as well :) There are some ups and downs as everywhere, some things that could be improved, so it's not perfect, but still good.

Filip: It is manual written by my father for device he is manufacturing
Alienor: Is it a long text?

Filip: Do not think so.
Alienor: If it is not too long I am happy to translate it

Alienor: <file_other> section_D, <file_other> section F
Alienor: I had to modify it to make it more French so it is not 100% following your text, but it means the same.
Alienor: I made it using Google Translate + correcting and adapting it so it is more French :D
Alienor: hope it is ok
Alienor: I usually do it that way so it is quicker and easier
Filip: Can I approach you in the evening about other one?
Alienor: no problem
Alienor: might only do it tomorrow though

Kelly: But maybe it's how it should be
Jenny: Yes
Jenny: a partner is not a dog
Jenny: They are free to go away any minute
Ann: Or a Disney princess (I am watching sleeping beauty now on TV)
Kelly: 😂😂😂 Yes, so they have the right to leave us and we should be able to see life after them always
Ann: Yes, this is the biggest problem of the ideology of love. The idea that love is life. Love has been equated with life. Especially for women, but not only, also for men. People can't imagine life without it
Kelly: Yes, but we love this dream of life that is love and love that is life
Ann: And this creates dependency, jealousy, frustrations, drama
Ann: It's not even a very beautiful dream to be with someone all your life. The promise of no change. Stability forever. It is what capitalism needs from us - 40 years of mortgage and marriage
Kelly: Ahaha, yes and that somebody will take care of us when we are sick. 
Ann: Love is beautiful, intense, crazy and brief. And it was transformed in a long lasting good, a house. Something like this.
Kelly: But i think, or I suppose that we should be able to love for life potentially. We cannot approach love with a plan
Ann: Yes, sure, but a substantial group of people, not one. But the problem is that love is mostly approached with one plan. Being together, get married, etc
Ann: Or now, under the new regime of supposed sexual freedom, with the opposite plan: nothings lasts and love doesn't matter. But this is substituting an ideology with another, when we should just let it be.
Ann: Simply 😅
Kelly: Yes, I agree
Jenny: and most of all this myth of love as life is a disappointing lie that makes people suffer a lot
Ann: Yes, the dependency that it creates is horrible
Ann: I see it with my friends, it breaks my heart
Kelly: sounds sad"

Mousie: Have you heard the latest? About the mayor of Gdansk?
Mousie: <file_other>
Joddie: NO!!! Why murdered?
Mousie: The bloke is obviously mentally unstable but what could've triggered it all off was the shitstorm created around the mayor by the gvt. When the official media say that he's bad then he must be also responsible for my failed life. This sort of thing.
Joddie: So there's no direct, personal connection between the two?
Mousie: Not at all! The bloke maintains he'd been maltreated in prison under the PO administration and while Adamowicz was PO, then he'd been responsible for it. Beyond any comment!
Joddie: Who said so?
Mousie: That's what he shouted still on the crime scene.
Joddie: Was he apprehended on the spot?
Mousie: <file_other>
Mousie: The murderer is a puppet, it's the background of his act that is threatening to our future. This ruling party is in fact responsible for Adamowicz's death, not a poor and deluded halfwit (sorry, man!). Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.
Joddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.
Mousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.
Mousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society. I feel like vomiting!
Joddie: Could never understand those who voted for Kacz and his private party!
Mousie: But there was no choice! You have no idea what a bunch of self-supportive buggies PO had become!

Rick: New York
Diddy: You think we can get tickets? It's always hard when they're in town.
Rick: Yeah, there'll always be some, just gotta go down and see. If not, we'll do something downtown.
Diddy: Cool. Did you see last night's game against the Royals? We killed 'em.
Rick: I just caught the last 2 innings, but I saw the Bichette homer, it was a monster!
Diddy: Yeah, one of the longest ones hit this year. I'm feeling this could be our year
Rick: Yeah, it's looking good.
Diddy: Hey, you have any Jays caps or jerseys or something?
Rick: I just have 1 cap. Didn't you have the Jays shirt?

Neil: It's not an actual personality test, you know? It's just a game for kids :P
Danielle: Hey, don't be such a bore! It might not be prepared by a certified psychologist but it's still fun.
Tracy: Exactly! It's not like I believe it tells me something about my personality. But the results are often so funny.
Darren: But you know that if you find the key to the author's way of thinking, you can crack such tests to get whatever result you want?
Neil: And the questions are often totally moronic.
Darren: Right, because they're made up by teenagers.
Danielle: You're seventeen, Darren. Technically speaking you're still a teenager too :P
Tracy: Bwahaha, I got Trelawney! XD

13680284,"Tessy: Good morning Harry! Just thought I'd drop you a line before disappearing to the other side of the world. At the moment I'm on the train to Frankfurt airport, then off to Cuba for 5 weeks. Can't wait to be there!
Harry: A very good morning to you dear Tessy! How nice you are in touch. So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!
Tessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?
Harry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.
Tessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?
Harry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.
Tessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL
Harry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?
Tessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?
Harry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.
Tessy: Smashing! Where to?
Harry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.
Tessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?
Harry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.
Tessy: Apart from royals in Kitzbühel :)) 
Harry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.
Tessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!
Harry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.
Tessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)
Harry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.
Tessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.
Harry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.
Tessy: STB you are.
Harry: What the hell is STB?
Tessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt. So see you in January!

Jim: Thank you for contacting me. Could you tell me a little more about the project?
Tom: That's why we want to meet with you to discuss it and offer you the opportunity of working with us. Meet you at 7:20pm on Stokes Croft?
Jim: That sounds interesting and thank you for offering me the opportunity of meeting with you but I would really like to know more about the project so I can prepare myself.
Jim: Can you please tell me what the project is about? When does it start? How long does it go for? And  is it paid or unpaid?
Tom: Dude we're offering you and opportunity to meet with us and discuss the project. I don't talk about project details online with no one. It is highly confidential.
Tom: So are you meeting with us or not tonight?
Jim: I would love to but I really need to know a little bit more about it so I can decide if it something that I would be interested in.
Tom: What part of we want to meet with you don't you understand?
Tom: We're offering you an opportunity to work with us and some very well known people. If you want to know more you have to come to the meeting.
Jim: OK. But is it a paid project?
Tom: I don't discuss money online.
Tom: I think you're not understanding me here. I'm giving you an opportunity to get somewhere with your work and you're trying to dictate terms to me.
Tom: I think this opportunity isn't right for you mate. I need people with passion and dedication and you don't sound to me like you're one of those.
Jim: Of course I might be potentially interested but like anyone else I need to pay rent, bills and buy food and opportunity doesn't pay the bills nor does exposure or experience.
Jim: So with all due respect unless you can give me a small brief about the project it is really hard for me to say yes.
Tom: Fine have ti your way. Your loss.
Tom: I'll just contact your competition and offer them the opportunity.
Jim: Please do.
Tom: I will! With that attitude you'll never get anywhere in life! Wanker!"

Chrissy: You know what? I think I could take a bus.
Tara: And I already hoped I'll have a whole half of pizza for myself :D
Chrissy: You love to talk about food, but actually you eat even less than me.
Tara: Not my fault I feel full too soon ;(
Pauline: You're saying it like it's a bad thing. Take a look in the mirror! :P
Tara: But I really love food! It'd be great if I could eat more at once.
Pauline: And you'd probably stay as skinny as you are.
Chrissy: Right? It's not fair! I don't eat much but I'm still fat ;(
Tara: You're not fat, you moron! You look perfectly fine!
Pauline: And you've got boobs! And sexy hips! You know how much other girls envy you?
Tara: Exactly. I look like a coat hanger in every dress I wear.
Chrissy: I don't think I've ever seen you in a dress.
Tara: And now you know why :P
Pauline: Come on, stop it with the negativity, both of you. We're all pretty and sexy, and that's what we need to keep telling ourselves.
Chrissy: Sorry, but if you burn your pizza and then tell it that it's not burned, it'll still be burned anyway.
Pauline: Maybe, but I like pizza when it's burned :P
Tara: So you're saying that someone's gonna like us even if we're “burned”? :D

Nick: I know, but then again the whole game is soo good.
Haley: True that
Nick: So what did you sacrifice?
Haley: Arcadia Bay.
Nick: Srsly?? I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.
Haley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me. What did you choose? 
Nick: I sacrificed Chloe, obviously.
Haley: obviously :P
Haley: You know it's almost 50/50 with this choice among the players
Nick: I've seen the statistics, yes. So why did you choose Chloe?
Haley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.
Nick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?
Haley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.
Nick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.
Haley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?
Nick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact. I just didn't really feel that close to Chloe, I guess.
Haley: I totally adored her and actually felt guilty a lot o f times on Max's behalf for abandoning her like that those years ago. I know Chloe is difficult and troublesome, but for me that was kinda lovable.
Nick: I didn't connect with her like that at all. I mean it wasn't ok, what Max did, but I feel like Chloe was constantly guilt tripping Max throughout the game. It was kinda annoying.
Haley: i dindn't really see it that way. Chloe's just sorta emotional, says what she feels.
Nick: That's a polite way to put it but ok. :P What about the other choices? And most importantly - did you water the plant? :D
Haley: Yes! :D I watered it exactly right.
Nick: Haha, me too. I wish I was able to do that in real life :P"

Amy: Not necessarily. There was this girl that answered that she's ready to take on new duties, but when asked in person to do so, refused.
Peter: That's what I basically meant.
Amy: And, yeah, she's screwed. No promotion for her. Her choice.

Peter: Y? Ppl don't want to earn more money?

Amy: Getting to it. After the form, every person is asked for an interview with the boss. Today was his turn.

Rob: 🔴 Yeah, a total dick. He did a nice round-up at the end in which he scoffed at our papers and basically said we were a bunch of silly losers. After which he asked us to provide a definition of politics, just to make sure we even understood what it was.
Clarice: @Hugh for your information, Rob is exaggerating less than usual
Hugh: Fuck, sounds insane
Juan: It was. But I actually had a very good time. Rob was the last one to answer the ""question"" and he gave a truly moving performance -of scorn and intellectual superiority 💖
Hugh: Ha ha ha how so
Clarice: Well, I don't wish to interrupt but I think it's not without importance that Rob actually began his answer by laughing the chair in his face
Juan: Sounds like a nice prelude 🎼
Rob: Indeed, that bit I really forgot lol. Anyway, I told him that as he has asked such a big question I was going to answer a few more. So I defined not only politics but also History, Art and Literature 😂😂😂😂
Clarice: And the best thing was that the guy actually seemed to enjoy the answer, even though it was apparent that Rob was mocking him from beginning to end. So weird...
Rob: I agree with Clarice, he looked me in the eye all the while, nodding with approval

Isla: hmm, sorry. I am currently researching on the most popular names in the UK in the last 30 years.

Isla: and tiring. I try to figure out if political events have much influence on names that people give to their children in this country.

John: Come on, tell me more!!
John: Mom asks how long did it take you to get to the office. 
Liliana: The office is about 15 minutes away from my house, so I can get there on foot.
Liliana: My boss seems to be ok, she's pretty easy-going and likable, so I'm comfortable working with her.
John: That's great! :) And what about your colleagues? What are they like?
Liliana: Most of my colleagues are far younger then me, which feels weird, but I think I'll have to get used to it.
Liliana: There's just one girl at my age, but she's such a nerd, that it's really hard to talk with her, if you're not interested in stuff that she is.
Liliana: When I asked her about her favourite books, she told me she had about 100 books about Java.
Liliana: She only reads manuals, she doesn't watch films or go out...
Liliana: Oh, sorry, she watches ONLY ""Mission Impossible"" (all parts) and anime. :/
John: Oh, I've never thought that people like this really exist.
Liliana: Right?
Liliana: She’s like Sheldon from “Big Bang Theory”.
John: I hope you’ll find common ground with her, honey. Maybe she needs sometime to open up?
Liliana: I don’t know, dad, I think she’s just a weirdo.
Liliana: Nevertheless I’ll try to get along with her - what else can I do?
John: And that’s the right attitude, darling. :)"

Nadia: he's not being honest with you. I was fighting myself whether or not I should tell you cause I got this information from someone else, but as you're my bestie, you gotta know the truth
Anne: ok, now I'm worried as fuck.
Nadia: do you remember when he was supposed to visit you? and then we saw him a few days later, on my birthday, with this Alexis in the pub?
Anne: yeah...pathetic but I forgot about this
Nadia: then watch this
Nadia: I heard yesterday that he was in fucking love with her and wanted to be with her, but she said no and that was even the reason why she's not at the university now
Anne: wait waaat
Nadia: yes, exactly
Anne: who told you that?
Nadia: Jason. He told me they spent some time on talking and he told that he was in love with Alexis and also had an opportunity to be with some other girl, but Alexis was better and that's why he chose her.
Anne: how could I be so naive
Nadia: I'm not telling you that to make you sad or whatever, but to make you aware of the facts. I was shocked too, to be honest. It seems that he was playing with you, trying to attract her at the same time.
Anne: I don't know what to say
Nadia: don't say anything, just get used to it slowly and think if there is any sense to continue that
Nadia: if this is worth your time and feelings
Anne: I'm so happy I can always count on you...if not you, then I guess I'll never know about all of this and live not knowing anything
Nadia: no problem, as you said you can always count on me. I just don't want anyone to fool you or something
Anne: how can anyone be such a jerk
Anne: I just don't fucking get it. I was always so good for him, if he wanted to date her, then why would he waste my time
Nadia: cause some people are simply like that, they don't care or they just lack this ability to think about others, unfortunately...
Anne: I'm really pissed off right now
Nadia: just don't do anything reckless and try to act as if you didn't know anything. cause if you don't, then he'll figure out that Jason told someone.
Anne: Ok, I promise I'll try.

Peggie: Would you remember old Mr Lars, my next door neighbour? Well, he passed away two months ago. A stroke, I heard. Such a nice person! And not that old at all. 86 or something.
Hettie: Congratulations and best wishes to Laura! So how many children have they got now? I've somehow lost count.
Hettie: Yes, I remember him. So sorry to hear about his death.
Peggie: With the twins four. It's Simon whose family keeps on growing. They have got five children and Adela, Simon's wife, says she'd like to have a baby again. Well... They can surely afford it so why not? They are a very harmonious family.
Hettie: I can understand that you don't want to leave the house you've spent most of your life in. It's such a beautiful house too.
Hettie: By the way, we will probably be moving house soon too. A real estate agent, in fact a good friend of ours, has found an old farmhouse in need of a major overhaul in the area close to the Grampians. I have always wanted to live there! What's more, Thomas will be able to continue his research work in the National Park. We are both quite thrilled and hope it will happen.
Peggie: Why shouldn't it, if I may ask?
Hettie: Sorry to be so confused about all these kids!
Hettie: It's a question of funds, very banal.
Peggie: I'm sure you can sort it out. Anyway I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
Hettie: Thanks Peggie. And thank you for the birthday wishes! Always nice to chat with you - across the ocean.
Peggie: My pleasure. Aren't these electronic and digital gadgets wonderful? I'm so proud I've mastered the basic use of my smartphone. Very useful!
Peggie: So all the best to you and please give my regards to Thomas.
Hettie: Thanks a lot. Love!"

13680292,"Brenda: Hello bro, you've got an invalid sister. I fell in the bathroom and badly hit my side. Can hardly move now.
Andy: Good gracious! How did you manage that?
Brenda: The floor was wet after I had a shower and I wanted to shake the rug, moved too fast, slipped, and hit with a thump my left side below the breast against the edge of the bathtub. Took my breath away for a sec. I even yelled or groaned or gasped. Anyway I was on the floor, shocked. Absolutely shocked. I thought, so that's how it happens. But I managed to get up and didn't realise the pain until I stretched to put my nighty on. Oh bro... Horrible....
Andy: You could have killed yourself. Where are you now?
Brenda: In bed. But I can hardly move. It's very painful all over the body. SHIIIIT!
Andy: Maybe you should call in an ambulance? Are you sure you haven't broken something? A rib?
Brenda: No, then I'd be howling with pain. It's just the impact of the fall that has, I don't know, damaged the tissue. Whatever I have here. Fat I suppose. It has to heal by itself.
Andy: Can you breath normally?
Brenda: Yes. I can't take a deep breath though.
Andy: Can you touch your bruised side? Is it swollen? Red?
Brenda: I can touch it, not press of course, but stroke. No, it isn't swollen. The skin is as usual, no discolouration. But this will come later, I suppose.
Andy: Not necessarily. It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.
Andy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?
Brenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...
Andy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.
Brenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning. Fucking hell! I can hardly pull myself up.
Andy: If I were you, I would go and see the doc first thing in the morning.
Brenda: And he'll send me to have an x-ray. I can't bear the thought of driving or even walking.
Andy: Well, he can come to your place and you'll be driven to hospital in an ambulance.
Brenda: You stop scaring the shit out of me! I am not that invalid. It's just bloody painful but I think I'm in one piece.
Andy: I don't know Brenda. One shouldn't take it too light those falls. You may still be in a state of shock and are underrating your condition. Will you phone me first thing in the morning please? Still from bed? Luise is gone by 7:30, so you won't be waking anyone up.
Brenda: OK brother. I will give you a call. Of course if I'm still alive.
Andy: Sister!! Anyway I wish you a good night's sleep. Have a good rest!
Brenda: Thanks bro. Sleep tight too.

Kim: Yeah, but I'm not using it much any more since I've switched to PS.
Frank: Yes! I've been wanting to ask you! How is it? In comparison with PC?
Kim: Honestly? I love it.
Kim: I know that many would like to stone me for saying that, but I don't see that much difference with PC and it's faaaar more comfortable.
Frank: Even the graphics? I've heard you will never have the same effect on PS as on PC.
Kim: Well, it's true, but I mostly enjoy the plot, the mechanics etc, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on something.
Frank: Hm... interesting.
Kim: If you're more into graphics than you can always watch some videos on YouTube where people compare PC and PS, but, to my mind, the differences are minimal.
Kim: Also, if you really want to have amazing graphics you need quite a powerful PC, PS is more affordable.
Frank: yeah, but games are more expensive.
Kim: Not on Cyber Monday :D depends how much you play, it usually takes me quite a while to finish one.
Frank: I'm more an occasional player, so I don't if there's any point.

Ben: No, I can't possibly accept that.
Zoe: By way of apology. 
Ben: Out of the question.

13829270,"Mash: Hi Gorgeous! And? What is your news? Are you getting much work these days?
Gina: Hi there! Can't complain. Just enough commissions to keep me busy without overworking. Enough money too. And you?
Mash: I still work about 12-15 hours a week, which with my rental means that I am not dipping into my savings too much.
Gina: Sounds good. Is this journal Rose was an editor of still around?
Mash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year’s editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.
Gina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?
Mash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well. Rose's granddaughter will be graduating from college this summer. You met her, remember?
Gina: Tina?
Mash: Tilla. A short for some name but can't remember.
Gina: Always wanted to ask you: how old is Rose?
Mash: Not sure. My age? Must be older as she's bound to be getting her pension by now.
Gina: Has she retired yet?!
Mash: So I hear. ALTA secretary told me the other day.
Gina: And you, old man?
Mash: I get my state pension in 2021. But not having paid much into my pension plan I can't expect it entirely to support me.
Gina: And the estate? The rents?
Mash: That will do, though I'd have to cut on booze
Mash: D‑':
Mash: The smallholding is looking fairly neat these days (mainly due to Hellie). So I don’t work too hard there, but over the course of a year, I probably spend 4-5 hours a week working on it. Through butcher problems, we kept our pigs for a month longer than we expected this year, and in that time they grew by about 15-20 kilos each!. So my freezers are full to overflowing.
Gina: Pork is not good for you, they say. Especially for older folks.
Mash: We have decided to give the pigs a rest next year, since we should have plenty of meat. I really don't care if it's healthy or not as long as it tastes good.
Gina: Good old Mash!
Mash: It's me!
Gina: How grand to hear your news! 
Mash: You must come and visit me again.
Gina: We'll think about it!

13828286,"Ash: Thanks so much! I am feeling so much better. I'm gonna work on the next chapter as soon as I can. I'm hoping to actually work on it tonight, but I have to beta another story. Thanks again!!!
Mollie: Please do! I love all your stories but this one cuts the cake. :) I'm glad to hear you're feeling better :D and have fun Beta-ing! :P
Mollie: P.S. Can I ask dor a small-ish favour? Could you make Clara say (in that last chapter): ""run you clever boy"" or something like that? If not I get it :P
Ash: I'm not sure if I can in the last chapter, BUT I was thinking about it...I might be able to make another itty bitty cameo with he...and I might be able to have her say it... I gotta think about how to incorporate it! 
Mollie: There is an option to edit chapters - it's really weird but manageable. Wither way, having Clara back would be exciting :D
Ash: Yeah... I know how to do that. I just wasn't sure if it made sense for her to say ""clever boy."" But I'm gonna try to have her pop back in. Maybe in the last chapter. Want to make such a lovely reviewer happy :)
Ash: Maybe this will make up for it until we get there? 
Ash: <file_other>
Mollie: Hey!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply earlier - I had a couple of trips going on and literally no time to check the Internet!!! :( Now my Inbox is stuffed with emails that need replying -_-
Mollie: Anyhoo, can I say how honoured I am that I got to see a sneak peek of the chapter (do you do this to all of your reviewers?? ;) ) and how much it made me want to read more! The chapter's lovely; I can't wait to see everyone;s reactions to Ian's presence in New York. :D
Mollie: One technical issue though - how on earth are you going to explain Ian's incredible late workload? Sorry, i'm just being picky... :P
Ash: I'm glad you like the preview! No I only give certain people previews. If their comments have really touched me then I usually try to show my thanks by sending a preview. Chapter 27 picks up a couple months after Ian and Roses reconciliation. Ian did work in certain parts, like all day in Little Talks and several others. But you are right that he is behind, and I will make a comment to address that! Gotta keep ya all happy!!! ;) 
Mollie: Out of curiosity though, are you ever going to have Ian tell Rose about switching realities experience??
Mollie: You could always have that as additional chapter, or you could have a chapter showing everyone's reactions to Ian and Rose being toegther (that would always be worth reading! :P) Either way, you have fun writing :D
Ash: It's not my plan to have him reveal it. It was about the realization for Ian. About him seeing the truth that's always been there. I never felt that he needed to tell her about it. He just needed her.
Mollie: Awww, that last line *Swoon*
Mollie: But sure, it is your story :) You can do whatever you want :P
Mollie: What I keep wondering is what will happen to Ian once he reached 2025 in his own timeline, how will he react ect. Sorry for bugging you like this, it's all very interesting :P 
Ash: I hope I didn't come across rude!!! I wasn't at all trying to do that!!! I've had that question before. It's all a bit timey wimey and weird. It's not like Quantum Leap where one replaces the original and the ""original"" is somewhere.
Ash: It's more of he was given this gift of jumping forward, so see what his life is/what it could be. But he had to make the decision if he was going to follow through. Was he going to make it happen, or was he going to give up the one thing in his life that made it precious? Was he going to fight for Rose? Was he going to believe that she loved him and allow himself that love? Paradox-y yes. Does that help? 
Mollie: No, you didn't come off as rude - if anything, it made me think to myself: well done, you've just offended the author"" :P
Mollie: As for your explanation... er yeah kinda? I get why you did it for the plot (which also makes the plot more interesting), I'm just imaging Ian's reactions when he finally reaches 2025 and and thinks about how he woul have jumped timelines every day... am I making sense? Think of it as me creating a fanfic in my head of an actual fanfic :P"

Rachel Kavanagh: I can understand that. You did what you had to do. I am in Bham most weekends. I like comedy clubs. Got to have a laugh. This job is quite serious so it’s good to escape that.

13828490,"Frannie: Hi Jim
Jim: Oh, hi Fran
Frannie: I guess you're as horrified by tomorrow's exam as I am
Jim: I guess so too
Frannie: I didn't really understand the part about substrata and superstrata
Jim: It's easy actually, plus there is a good Wikipedia page about them XD
Frannie: I trust your notes from class more than Wiki
Jim: And rightly so! Anyway
Frannie: I'm listening (or rather reading)
Jim: A substratum or substrate is essentially a language that existed in a given territory before another language
Frannie: Ok
Jim: Then people speaking a different language arrived in that territory and slowly their language became the dominant one
Frannie: And then the older language influences the new one, right?
Jim: Yes. The substratum slowly disappears but leaves some traces in the new language (the superstratum) like some words, pronunciation aspects and so on
Frannie: Ok, so for example the Etruscan language was the substratum and Latin the superstratum, right?
Jim: Yes, and Etruscan influenced the local variety of latin in later centuries
Frannie: Ok
Jim: I have a question too
Frannie: You? I thought you were Mr. Perfect Notes
Jim: I am, but I missed two lessons in November
Frannie: Ok
Jim: So... what was exactly the story with the name ""Mediolanum""?
Frannie: Ok, I know this one. In the ancient Celtic languages the Indoeuropean consonant ""p"" wasn't pronounced, for example the word for ""father"" was ""athir"" (vs. ""pater"" in Latin for example). So according to many scholars ""Mediolanum"" came from ""medio-"" and ""planum"" because there is no ""p"", so it's basically ""in the middle of the plane"".
Jim: Ok! Thanks
Frannie: You're more than welcome, you helped me too
Jim: ;)
Frannie: Good luck for tomorrow!
Jim: Godspeed!"

Santakumar: This is terrible. Have the guards not been called?
Sandeep: Sir, yes, the guards have not been able to chase them out.
Santakumar: What have they tried?
Sandeep: They have tried getting them with food and tried setting off the fire alarm to scare them. Nothing has worked.
Santakumar: There must be something else we can do. Are the bay doors open?
Sandeep: The bay doors are left open for them to run out, but they are hiding in the ceiling.
Santakumar: Do we know where they are now?
Sandeep: Not really until they make a noise. We think they are in the Engineering offices.
Santakumar: Make sure they stay out of the test lab!
Sandeep: That is the fear. That they will damage valuable equipment.
Santakumar: How did they get in?
Sandeep: It is not known, but perhaps on a truck.
Santakumar: Well, if you have to call, do it today. Let me know the cost. 
Sandeep: I will do it now.
Santakumar: And I don't want them hurt or killed. They must be safely relocated.
Sandeep: Certainly.
Santakumar: That's all we need is animal cruelty on our heads.
Sandeep: Seems cruel to keep them shut in a factory too but they aren't smart enough to leave.

Samantha: Agreed. I've actually already done some research on natural selection. Just basic stuff like wikipedia but it cites some more serious sources. 
Tim: ok, great. Do you want to focus on anything in particular? Because how are we dividing this project?
Samantha: I think I'd like to talk about the history of the concept - like what was before Darwin and then about his idea in the ""origin of species"" 
Tim: I've actually just finished reading the selfish gene by Dawkins and I would like to incorporate some of the stuff from the book. 
Samantha: Oh cool, was it good?
Tim: Great even. I've always thought it's a shame that he's mostly known as the chief atheist when he's really a brilliant biologist. 
Samantha: I've always kinda associated Dawkins with the atheist stuff tbh I've only recently found out about his scientific work
Tim: Yeah, many people do that and it's a shame. You know that he coined the term meme?
Samantha: oh cool, i had no idea. 
Tim: so it would be great to talk about he's ideas in the presentation 
Tim: *his
Samantha: sure, you can talk about the modern understanding of natural selection and include Dawkins there 
Tim: So I would give like the modern definition of it
Samantha: Yeah, seems like it. If you want. 
Tim: sure, can do that. What else do we need? 
Samantha: So we have - the history, the actual modern definition... maybe the evidence? We could mention like... you know, all the things they've dug up ;) 
Tim: yes, the fossils and all that. 
Tim: That's a good idea. And then maybe why it's important? Like how it changed science?
Samantha: oh, that would be good - why it matters when it comes to our understanding of humanity's development, origin etc. 
Samantha: So you wanna take that part?
Tim: Yeah, could be interesting. 
Samantha: So I'll take the evidence part. 
Tim: Great. It seems evenly divided. 
Samantha: Think so too. Btw are we making a power point or using some other software?
Tim: I was thinking Prezi it's much nicer.

Fiona: I know, sounds terrible, but it's cool, really. We get along really well, what are the odds?
Ian: But you have your own room or are you sharing?
Fiona: Ok, not that social, I have my own room :)
Ian: That must be a huge house...
Fiona: Hahaha, yeah, it is quite big. It's quite difficult to get your head around at first, we have a patio and there's an extension there were two people live. There are also three floors, so we fit quite all right.
Ian: Glad to hear that :) Is it somewhere central? Is the neighbourhood safe?
Fiona: The whole country is safe, trust me, it's probably the safest place on earth as there's literally nothing happening here.
Fiona: I think the last time someone was murdered here was decades ago :P
Ian: Very funny :P
Fiona: I don't live in the central area, but I have couple of buses to choose and it takes around 20 minutes to get to the old town.Told you - pretty cool ;)
Fiona: <file_photo>
Fiona: Here's the old town. The city is tiny though, it took me 15 minutes to visit all the sights near the city centre :D
Ian: Oh, whoah, that is small. How do you find it? Aren't you bored then?
Fiona: Hm, not yet, but you know, I arrived here only a few days ago. So far I had one weekend to discover the city, went out once with my colleagues and housemates.
Ian: Found any nice bars, pubs? Are there any? ;)
Fiona: A few, yes :P I'm quite worried that I may visit all of them before my contract here ends, but it's not too bad.
Fiona: But when you come to visit, we really need to go to this one cafe, it's brilliant. They have the most amazing cakes.
Fiona: <file_photo>
Ian: Booked my tickets already ;)
Fiona: You're joking?
Ian: Uhm, no? Aren't you happy?
Fiona: oh my god, of course I am!!!
Ian: :)
Fiona: When are you arriving? <3 Can't wait!!!

Gerard: Won't trigger ""die""
Alleatha: Thankee :)

Jimmy: Always good ;) you?
Sammy: Fine, a bit of a mess here recently, but nothing really bad
Tom: I've been following the protests in France recently
Tom: but, honestly, I don't understand very well what it is all about.
Theo: it was motivated by rising fuel prises and high cost of living
Tom: Do you think it's populist?
Tom: That's what they always say in media
Theo: I'm not sure, they're demanding more justice, I can't see populists elements in it
Jimmy: I really don't like the word populism
Jimmy: I don't think it describes anything anymore
Theo: I read a Guardian article about it some times ago, they tried to built a definition of it
Jimmy: and how did they define it?
Theo: <file_other> ""Populism is usually described as a strategic approach that frames politics as a battle between the virtuous, “ordinary” masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite"".
Jimmy: Yes, but that's actually quite a lib-cons vision, because aren't we in a kind of struggle between an ""elite"" and ordinary people?
Jimmy: with all the tax evaders, corporations, growing inequalities? 
Theo: maybe you're right
Jimmy: it's not surprising that people want a change
Theo: The only stupid thing is that then they vote for Trump, Salvini and Orban
Jimmy: Exactly, so maybe we should call ""populism"" all the parties, politicians, movements that promise to address the inequalities and problems, but actually make them worse or focus on even less privileged groups (refugees, unemployed, immigrants, minorities) and blame them for the problems... which of course makes problems only worse
Theo: haha, that's a much better definition than that of the guardian, I think
Jimmy: hahah, thanks"

Andy: I'm getting very interested in a cruise now x x
Carly: I'll come with you if you want.. you can get the taster ones for 3 or 5 days leave Southampton, the one I went on with Mum had a shopping mall in the centre of the ship.. it was amazing.. x
Andy: Looks great we could have a great laugh together😂😂  you will have to come with me to show me the ropes x x
Carly: I'd love too.. let me know your holidays and I'll see what's about.. the taster ones can be done on a long weekend mind xx

Carly: I'm flexible with my work too so we may find a decent cheap on.. we paid 400 each for that one we were on xx
Andy: We need a balcony suite for def xx
Carly: Defo, no point in going on a cruse if you cant see the sea from your bed :) 
Andy: Hello you 😊I had a look online last night but it's a bit of a cruise minefield to be honest lol x x
Carly: Yes it is a bit.. there's a 3 day taster to Bruges in Sept 300 ish each from Southampton .. no point in booking for longer unless you know you will like it... you could be green hanging over the side all week lol xxx
Andy: If it sounds like it's a good deal and it's the right accommodation then I think we should book us a little getaway then x x
Carly: Yes definitely be good.. I'll send you details tomorrow xxx
Andy: Send me the dates and I will book the holiday with work
Carly: Ok will do xxx I'm excited xx
Andy: So am I. We are going on a cruise 😊😊x x
Carly: There is an 80's special for 5 days but it's about 500 and we would probably end up drunk and disorderly
Andy: Well I thought we would end up drunk and disorderly anyway lol. How do you feel about that one or are you wanting just a bit less mayhem 😊x x
Carly: No it would be fab I expect I'll find out more and see how much I  can afford lol xx How about Southampton to Bruges back to Southampton on 5th Oct for 3 nights.. 366pp.. balcony suite..
Andy: Sounds good, I'll come over this weekend and we can look together xx

Wallis: so why did you go on a date with someone new?
Lisa: it's safe to never assume that there will be second date
Lisa: so it is not cheating
Wallis: to me it sounds strange but maybe that's how it works
Lisa: I think it's different than dating two people that you already know
Lisa: when you ask someone you already know, there's some emotional attachement already
Wallis: I don't know if it really works
Lisa: and the odds are different
Wallis: most couples meet each other thanks to mutual friends
Lisa: true, but it's hard when all your friends are taken

Thomas: We recorded an authorized access last night in the lab.
Marshall: How’s that possible? Were all security systems on?
Thomas: Yes, he knew the knew the access code to our mainframe, in such case systems may be disabled, but I have created my own system that informs me if something like that happens.
Marshall: He? You know, who was it?
Thomas: Broderick spencer, sir.
Marshall: Him? Well, there will be a very interesting conversation between us, then I have to dismiss him.
Thomas: Sir? You can’t tell ANYONE  you know about it.
Marshall: Why not?
Thomas: Because then everyone will know I have this backup system, it’s illegal and strictly forbidden by my agreement.
Marshall: Great, so why you’re giving me an information I can’t even use?
Thomas: You can. You can control him closely, even spy on him let’s say and after he makes something like that again, boom, he’s imprisoned.
Marshall: That would be a bit harsh…
Thomas: But he will be an example for the others!!
Marshall: It is true, of course…
Thomas: I told you ; )

Maximilian: Sounds good. Either way, we should hook up when we're there. It would be nice.
Estrella: Sure! If I stay there just 2 weeks, I will probably stay at my friend's place in sintra. If I get any job, I will try to rent something in lisbon
Maximilian: I never asked: how did your English test go? I recall doing it with you at the time. I'll probably stay at a place rented by my firm.

Gillian: oh. don't even get me started...

Brad: Workers are workers, they're ok, but the guy we hired - their boss - he's just impossible to work with.
Gillian: I literally hate this guy.
Brian: What's so bad about him? 
Gillian: First of all, when we hired him he told us it'll take ""about 3 weeks"" to get this renocvation done. He had done half of it by the third week. 
Brad: It's been almost 2 months now and they MIGHT be nearing the end
Gillian: the worst part is that he knows we're not gonna ditch him, because it's so hard to get a renovation crew. Most of them are available like two months from now and we need to move in fast.
Brad: We're sort of desperate and he knows that, so he takes his sweet time.
Brian: I'm sorry to hear that
Gillian: and he has a really condescending attitude and treats us like morons.
Gillian: especially me, because I'm a woman
Brad: you don't know that for sure
Gillian: yes I do. Basically, we don't understand all the technicalities of this renovation so he can get away with a lot of things. I try to fact-check him sometimes, but he'll just brush it off, cause he knows better.
Brad: We're staying at Gillian's sister's apartment and I feel we really overstay our welcome. 
Gillian: I mean, she's my sis, she's gonna host us as long as we need and doesn't say anything, but I feel she'd like to have more space for herself. 
Brian: I get that. I hope they finish soon.

Jane: They were flying with Ryanair. Fiona said they were crazy tired and almost missed their boarding, but were admitted eventually. They followed the crowd and ended up in a wrong queue. It was an early morning flight, I think the flight attendant was simply tired and missed that tiny detail that they were flying to Manchester, not Madrid

Mr. Benson: Of course. I'll tell Lona later to book both days for you. One is on the company.
Mark: Thank you, sir. I'll be right back. 
Mr. Benson: All right. Claudia - Since you have the smallest workload I want you to call all out major clients and ask them about client satisfaction. Lona has the survey, so ask her for it.

Lucy: No, I'm not, being honest.
Ann: Why? Because he always says this slightly stupid jokes?
Lucy: The jokes are not a problem even. He seems very insincere and just a hustler.
Ann: What do you mean?
Lucy: Do you remember the last party at the university, when he was bartending? 
Ann: Sure, that was fun.
Lucy: Could be better. At some moment I gave him a note of 50 and didn't get my change. So I asked for it and he replied that there was no change now and I should come back later. That was already strange. I returned after 15 minutes and he gave me 10, instead of 45. I said it was not all, so he gave me another 10. I had to tell him something like ""listen Adam, I gave you 50, the drink was 5, you owe me 45"". Even after this he came back only with 30. I had to press him a few times, it was super unpleasant.
Ann: That's really strange.
Lucy: I know. It was quite late already. After midnight. I think he assumed people are drunk, have fun, and nobody would notice that something is wrong with money. Especially when your mate is bartending.
Ann: Possibly. But he's also quite well off, why would he do anything like this?
Lucy: I don't know. I'm just telling you what happened.
Ann: Right
Lucy: And you know, it's not really about money for me. It's about who this guy is.

Bethany: sounds weird.
Callum: it's a BDSM/kink practice.
Bethany: And you shove things into your penis?
Callum: yes, that's what they do!
Bethany: Anything?
Callum: of course not, here is some wikipedia: ""Urethral play can involve the introduction of either soft or rigid items into the meatus of the penis (as well as farther in). Objects such as sounds are usually only inserted about halfway into the glans and can usually be easily retrieved.""
Bethany: Isn't it dangerous?
Callum: Theoretically it is, if you don't do it carefully. But people who practice it claim it's not, and allegedly it's quite pleasant and stimulating.
Bethany: Oh, I was wondering why would anybody do it?
Callum: But you can have the same question for many things we do in life, right? Why do people go bungee jumping?
Bethany: Right.
Callum: But sounding is supposed to stimulate, it's pleasant as the people claim, also the idea of penetration is stimulating for some of them.
Bethany: Are there special objects for it?
Callum: Sure, you can even buy a sounding-kit, you'll find everything on the internet.

Judith: They kept him overnight in hospital and he was brought home this morning.
Polly: D'you have to do any caring?
Judith: Oh no! He insists on his independence, especially with the catheter. I'm relieved.
Polly: Sure. You've got enough to do, I suppose.
Judith: Oh yes, I do. We are preparing for the Christmas holiday bookings. We've some nice lengthy reservations for the Queen suite. I've blocked the King suite for family visits.
Polly: We've wondered which is the Queen and which the King suite?
Judith: The Queen is the room next to our office, the one facing our road. The King is downstairs.
Polly: Oh, I thought the suite downstairs was much bigger.
Judith: So it is! That's why we named it King suite.
Polly: I must be damned feminist expecting the best being Queen! ;)
Judith: That's interesting! At the start Bill too was adamant about it claiming that the best should be allocated to Queen. Him being British! But we finally followed the generally accepted definitions of queen-size and king-size, the latter being bigger.
Polly: Good gracious! Now you have corrected my erroneous thinking! Thank you, Judith! Of course a king-size bed is bigger than a queen-size.
Judith: Pleasure :))
Polly: Us queens being petite!
Judith: Your turn to be sexist!
Polly: Moi?!
Judith: :)
Polly: How did you name the one we're staying in?
Judith: Now comes a surprise: Prince suite.
Polly: So you definitely need one more to call it Princess suite.
Judith: I wouldn't say no! The income is substantial! They are our bread and butter.
Polly: So your idea has been paying off. Congrats!
Judith: I'm so happy about it. Even if it means heaps of work.
Polly: Happy for you!"

Andrea: The longest I could resist smoking was like 2 weeks but it always comes back like a boomerang...
Thomas: I quit after 7 years
Thomas: That was a terrible battle!
Andrea: How did you manage to do that after all that time?!
Thomas: It was a combination of a good strategy and the power of will
Jacob: I think I know what you mean
Jacob: Was it like reducing the amount of cigarettes periodically?
Thomas: Something like that plus trying to draw attention from any thought urging me to reach for a cig
Andrea: It seems so simple but once you try, you realize that it's not that easy :/
Thomas: True. But look, Andrea, Jacob has taken the bull by the horns and succeeded
Jacob: Thanks Thomas, at least I'm trying.
Jacob: But sometimes it's extremely hard to resist temptation...
Thomas: Yes, definitely. Especially at the initial stage of the process
Andrea: But you know guys, all that you've written here so far feels like kind of motivation for me, as strange as it may sound
Andrea: Because, you know... If you two could, why can't I?
Jacob: Of course, you should try again!
Thomas: Don't you even hesitate. Just think to yourself in this way:
Thomas: This is a little awful cigarette, every time I light it up it kills me, it smells bad to me and to others, more money is lost and actually it holds power over me. Why would I be a slave of a small shitty thing like that? I'm strong enough to resist it, I'm bigger than that!
Andrea: All right! I just need to keep convincing myself that I'm bigger than that!
Thomas: Just be consistent in doing so :)
Jacob: And buy a lot of sweets, you'll need them. At the beginning at least :D
Thomas: Right, they can soften the shock after quitting smoking.

Surinder: It is actually white with a red blob on its head.
Kate: Red cap oranda. They are supposed to represent the flag of Japan.

Deirdre: Not too great, actually! Just finished my email to Vivaldi head office.
Sharon: Why, what happened? You usually have a great time.
Deirdre: Well, we do, but the complex has been taken over by new management and they are a bunch of lazy twats, not to put too fine a point on it!
Sharon: Oh my God, what did they do?
Deirdre: How long have you got! First, we booked in and they'd given away the only ground floor apartment available to someone else, so I was cross to begin with. I was watching little Ben like a hawk around that balcony. I did specify ground floor only when we booked too!
Sharon: How irritating!
Deirdre: Exactly! Well, next day, we all decided to go in the pool, James and Ben went in the toddler pool and I took Rosie and Megan in the big one with me as they can swim pretty well. Next thing we know, we have to get out as our eyes are streaming and Ben has grabbed a large floating toddler poo from his pool and is playing with it!
Sharon: That's vile, was it chemicals in the pool that did it?
Deirdre: Yep, far too much chlorine, awful. We could hardly see for a couple of hours and both pools were evacuated immediately, of course! So not a great first day!
Sharon: You poor things, did  everything improve at all later?
Deirdre: Not really! They did have some great entertainment at night, to be fair, but every other night, they seemed to carry on playing music until 2 or 3 am AND we were right over the bar and restaurant. Awful! We did complain, but nothing was done about it.
Sharon: How was the food?
Deirdre: Nice actually, most of the time, but there was so little of it, we were still hungry. The girls being 12 are growing like weeds and need decent amounts. I thought half board would be good, but we had to buy snacks quite a lot of the time to fill the gaps!
Sharon: That Vivaldi lot really are shit! The tv adverts make them sound really high end.
Deirdre: Well, we're obviously asking for compensation, especially because of the chlorine incident. A lot of people are furious, you should see the comments on Trip Advisor!
Sharon: Gosh, I hope you manage to sort it, what a pain!
Deirdre: Yes, we are certainly not going to that place again. Luckily, the timeshares in the UK have all been fab. Anyway, see you next week, Sharon! Cut and blow dry, Tues. at 6pm, wasn't it?

Mag: About Brexit?
Tom: Yes, there is a group of students that wants to create a movement demanding another referendum
Mag: nice!
Tom: Yes, but people were not convinced that it makes sense at all, they believe the first one is still binding 
Mag: Sure, we may hate it, but we should accept the democratic decision
Tom: sure, but for this reason we should have another referendum
Mag: hmm, generally I agree, it just doesn't seem to be a possible option
Tom: If people demanded it, they would have to respond somehow
Mag: Maybe we could have a referendum about the deal May got in Brussels 
Tom: I think that's the best opportunity
Mag: Especially that so many people are disappointed with the deal
Tom: which is the most ridiculous! What did they think? That we would have all benefits of the membership and all benefits of being outside?
Mag: quite schizophrenic 
Tom: So maybe now at least some people will realise that it's not going to be a fairy tale

Jane: So it kind of sounds Asia it is :D God, already excited <3
Patricia: hahahaha, so it does! When could you get any time off? August is off limits for me and probably not the best month to go there.
Jane: I know, July then? It may be cheaper, because no one wants to go there in the summer :D
Patricia: Quite true, July sounds fine for me. Gotta go tell my boss I need a time off and ready to go!

Eric: Ok.
Regina: U imagine something you want to draw on it and then take a pencil and draw it.
Eric: Bt that's destroying it!
Regina: Not so fast! After you've finished with the drawing you take some fibre and threads and start embroidering!
Eric: And that's how you get a nice pattern on table linen?
Regina: Ofc. Sure, you can buy something machine-made, but making ur own is far more satisfying!
Eric: I'm quite sure it is. So how long does it take you?

Irene: Would that work  Andrew?
Andrew: Yer, no problem. I’ll be attending a conference and doing some research at Senate House too, so it might make more sense to meet towards the end of the week
Sophie: Yeah, Friday evening or Saturday anytime would be ideal for me
Andrew: Cool 👍🏽
Andrew: I’ll get back to you when a place comes to mind. I’d say let’s meet somewhere central
Sophie: Sounds good to me 👍

13680505,"Samantha: Hi Soph, how about some more apples? We've got tons!!! Would you like another batch?
Soph: Hello Samantha, in fact I might. They ARE so tasty. But not too much please.
Samantha: There's no such thing as too much apples :))
Soph: One basket or two will be enough!
Samantha: Great! I'll get you a small basketful of cooking apples and a bigger one with different sorts of dessert apples. So happy they'll be put to good use:)
Soph: That sounds a lot! Thank you. I can always share them with my neighbor.
Samantha: I really don't know what to do with them all! We're eating them with everything really and I've made some apple puree and some apple chutney. But what else?
Soph: How about apple juice?
Samantha: But then I'd have to have it pressed. Professionally I mean. Can you have it done somewhere?
Soph: I think last year Oli and Natt took their whole apple harvest to some organic fruiter who's got a processing unit. And in exchange they received an adequate amount of juice.
Samantha: So it wasn't juice from their own apples?
Soph: As I understood it, no. But doesn't matter since it was an organic grower. And I think a friend of theirs or something, they must know each other well, since he accepted their apples and they didn't have any official certificate or anything.
Samantha: That's an idea. Have you got their phone number? Or maybe could you ask them about that organic juice producer? You know Oli better than I.
Soph: I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you! Here's his number 07634 235 987 32.
Samantha: Ta, I'll contact him. Mike's thinking about buying a proper juice maker but I don't fancy all that work. Washing, pressing, bottling, pasteurising... No!
Soph: It's probably not worth it. Better to have it done professionally.
Samantha: My point exactly. Is it ok if I get you the apples tomorrow morning?
Soph: Nobody's home then but you can leave them on the terrace in the back.
Soph: I still have your apple basket. The one Mike'd bought apples last week. I'll put it on the terrace for you.
Samantha: So you've got it!  I thought I was missing one. It's alright, I still have more than enough of them :)
Soph: Very well then. And thanks for the apples.
Soph: And the delivery :))

Anna: Third?! You haven't said a thing before.
Victoria: Yeah, it was kind of pointless as I watched only 2 episodes.
Victoria: First time I watched just the first one, then first two episodes.
Anna: And? Couldn't get hooked? ;)
Victoria: No, surprisingly. I thought I was going to love it on the spot. It has everything I love - history, costumes, plot, time travel, and Scots.
Anna: That's why I recommended it you, thought you may love it.
Victoria: Maybe it wasn't the right time? I don't know really.
Victoria: I watched the first season already and can't wait for more :D
Anna: Hahaha, I'm so happy to hear it! Finally I will have someone to talk with and fangirl <3
Victoria: I must admit that Jamie Fraser is one of the reasons why I decided to keep watching ;)
Anna: No wonder! He's the reason I'm watching it at all, especially at the beginning.
Anna: I get why many people couldn't watch it. It's really good, but I also think that there's something missing.
Victoria: Yeah, I can't put my finger on it either, but I think I know what you mean. The show seems perfect, well done, good plot, characters, but it may come... bleak?
Anna: Hm... I love it to bits so I'm biased. I'm probably watching it for too long.
Victoria: Have you tried Black Sails? It's not the same obviously, but it's the same genre.
Anna: I did and I know many people love it, but this one of the show I couldn't make myself watching.
Victoria: Hahaha, same here. It's the same as I had with Outlander - watched 2-3 episodes and nothing.
Victoria: But so fair I only had two attempts ;)
Anna: I had one and decided I don't have enough time to force myself :P Too many good shows waiting "

Anna: News spreads fast I see!
Mary: They sure do! Especially the good ones - I'm really happy for you.
Anna: I must tell you I feel really motivated. It's been only a month, but I really want to keep it going.
Mary: I understand, I've been through it and it can be a bumpy road, but it's worth it.
Anna: Have you eaten any meat since you decided to become a vegetarian?
Mary: Unfortunately yes, as I said - bumpy road ;) What's important is to keep going. I once had some dumplings with meat and chicken broth.
Anna: Weren't you tempted to go back then?
Mary: No, not really. I had meat mostly when I couldn't have anything else and I was really hungry. Funny enough, I've been craving those dumplings, but felt absolutely awful after having them.
Mary: The farther you go, the less you want to eat meat. At least in my case.
Anna: I can imagine. Surprisingly I don't find it as difficult as I thought it was going to be. I still eat fish though.
Mary: I'm trying to become vegan, but THIS is hard, really. I like dairy, love butter, eggs...
Anna: Oh yes, life without cheesecake? OR PIZZA?!
Mary: My thoughts exactly. Well, it's doable, but at what cost. Don't have enough time to grind everything for hours.
Anna: Are you taking any supplements? My GP is going nuts over the news and is trying to scare me that I will ruin my health.
Mary: I know those kind of doctors, don't worry, you'll be perfectly fine ;)
Mary: I take supplements, especially in the winter as we don't have so many fresh veggies to choose from.
Anna: What would you recommend? I wanted to ask my GP, but judging on her general approach...
Mary: I highly recommend chlorella (pills), vitamin B12 and D3. Basically everything that has proteins and helps you absorb them.
Anna: Thank you so much!
Anna: It really feels like a new journey, so excited! :)
Mary: You need to come over so I can show you some recipes! And remember - if you have any doubts, problems, you can always ask me, I'll do my best to help :)"

Victor: Hi Lisa, I'm not asleep yet. I should thank you for joining us. Yes, it was a lovely afternoon and the girls loved it. I think they like you a lot.
Lisa: Hope they don't dislike me :)
Lisa: The choice of the place was great too. How come you know all those funny venues?
Victor: Don't forget I studied in this city and it has not changed that much. We used to patronise White Dame more than we should have, I'm afraid.
Victor: Did you like the food? I'm afraid they aren't at their best for vegetarians.
Lisa: I liked it even if the combination of mushrooms and oranges was a bit unusual. Anyway the wine was superb.
Victor: They've always had great wines from South America and from South Africa. Very little from Europe. But then one of the owners is Argentinian I believe.
Victor: You looked lovely, Lisa. I liked your new hairstyle a lot. Suits you!
Lisa: Thanks. I'll keep my hair short now. So comfortable!
Victor: But then you'll have long hair again, ok?
Victor: A! Let me send you the pics the waiter took of us today.
Victor: <file_photo>

Victor: <file_photo>
Lisa: Hope it's all?
Victor: Yes, all of them. Nice eh?
Lisa: Thxs. You look so serious in some!
Victor: After all it was my birthday party.
Lisa: And you've got to wait one whole year for the next one.

Stanley: Ok. Sorry to hear that. 
Stanley: I mean I'm happy that he's home with family, but I honestly miss You all - including Dymitr and I really want us all to meet and have a drink.
Angela: I've spoken to Przemek, he said he was not sure yet, but for now, he said that he's free on saturday evening. Unless his father asks him to visit him in Warsaw and to take care of kids for weekend.
Stanley: Ok. As for now, it's three of us. What about Aleksandra, Karol and Martyna?
Angela: As far as I know Martyna always does her best to come every time we gather. I'll write to her, but she probably will be nagging again that we should visit her in Germany.
Stanley: Yeah. It will be like: ""But I also remember, that You didn't want to come visit me in Frankfurt!"" !
Stanley: And we will be like: ""Oh, don't be mad! It's a lot easier for us to meet in Poznań than arrange a trip to Germany"".
Angela: Hahaha! I already have that vision in my head.

Angela: :) :) :)
Stanley: I've called Aleksandra. She said she didn't know yet, but she said that she thought they won't be able to come. Karol works in Bielsko-Biala, and commutes to Radom. They have a difficult situation, as he travels a lot to Sweden and they have little time for themselves, not to mention traveling to Poznań. 
Angela:: Ehh, I understand. Nevertheless, I feel sad.
Stanely: Don't be. I'm sure even without them we will have a great time! They usually don't come when we gather.
Angela: I know :(
Angela: There's no solution for that :(

Chris: It all depends on what you would like to do, are you interested in being a volunteer or in something paid?
Diana: I'm interested in travelling that's for sure, so I really want to go somewhere. If you have something that will allow me to get paid for my work and will be in line with my experience, that'd be absolutely wonderful.
Diana: I'm open for being a volunteer as well - the only problem's that I may not be able to afford to pay for the accommodation.
Chris: Most of the organisations we're cooperating with cover the cost of the accommodation of our volunteers. You usually pay for a plane ticket and food. Certain organisations offer pocket money
Diana: Yes, I saw one really interesting offer from Japan. They're looking for someone who could teach English in high school, although they listed some nationalities - didn't mention British, quite surprising in my opinion. Does it mean that I can't apply?
Chris: Could you please send me a link? We have a lot offers and it'd be easier for me to advice you if I know the offer
Diana: Sure <file_other>
Chris: Thanks!
Chris: Okay, so, I think in this case it shouldn’t be a problem. You may not be regarded as a preferred candidate, but I don’t think that you’re not eligible. Also, if you’re really interested, I’ll gladly contact the organisers and ask if they are interested in your profile.
Diana: That would be amazing! Thank you Chris!
Chris: If this one doesn’t work out, and please, be aware that we’re in touch with people all over the world so it may happen that you won’t get the job you applied for, are you interested in another position?
Diana: I think I’ll be happy to participate in any project in Japan (as a volunteer or not), unless it’s related to computers, IT, technology, etc. as I have absolutely no clue about that stuff
Chris: And what about North America? You mentioned that you may be interested in this as well
Diana: Yes, I think it’s pretty much the same as with Japan. I’m not too keen on being a teacher at a camp, but everything other than that would be great
Chris: Got it! I will look for something suitable. May you send me your CV?
Diana: <file_other>
Chris: Thanks! If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask :)
Diana: Thank you! I really appreciate your help Chris. The whole idea is brilliant, but I admit it’s a bit overwhelming and confusing especially as you’re new to the whole thing
Chris: No worries, I've heard that a lot and we're doing everything we can to facilitate the process and make it more user friendly
Chris: We also highly recommend everyone to visit us in one of our offices, so if you live in London, I'll be happy to meet you
Diana: Perfect!"

Jackie: Well, every year we gather around, sit together and think about the things we'd like to get 4 Xmas.
Kris: So there's no surprise then?
Jackie: No, but then we leave the lists on the table and forget about them. After some time we cross out the things we've bought 4 one another so that other ppl don't buy the same thing twice ;)
Kim: That's actually pretty sensible. Last Xmas I got 2 identical sweaters and 3 nearly identical hats!
Kris: Hahahaha! At least u didn't get socks!
Adam: What's funny about that?
Kris: Nothing. Just a stereotype that socks are on one hand the most popular present and on the other the least welcome one ;)
Adam: I can vouch 4 that. I get socks every year!
Jackie: Poor thing! Maybe u should do what I do?
Adam: Not a bad idea. How do I convince my family to do the same?
Kim: Just tell them? I'm also fed up with presents that don't suit me.
Jackie: Kim, maybe u should do the same?
Kim: Oh, I will! I'm going to do it 2nite at dinner table! They'll be so surprised!
Adam: I don't think mine will even want to consider it. 
Jackie: Y not? Just tell them how much more fun it is!
Adam: I don't think they'll understand! They think they know what's best 4 me, but have no idea what I like or want.
Kris: Mabe u should talk to them like from ur heart? Tell them that u enjoy their presents, but would like to get something specific this year. Speaking of which, have u got something particular in mind?
Adam: Actually, I do. I've been saving up for this stereo system, but need a little more cash so I thought that my parents could simply kick in a bit. 
Kris: And have u told them?
Adam: No. They wouldn't approve. They already think I list to music too loud.
Jackie: Still, worth a try. If u don't u'll never know. :)
Kim: I know! Come over to my place. I'll tell my parents and u'll know how to talk to yours!
Adam: That's actually not a bad idea. When do u want me over?
Kim: Around 6?
Jackie: Good luck, Kim!
Kris: I think I'll do the same. Better to get tailored presents ;)
Jackie: That's y I'm always happy with what I get :)"

John: OK. Is it really bad? I'd rather we talked about it now so I don't have to wait until Wednesday.
Rick: I was hoping to do it face to face. Let's wait until we meet on Wednesday.
John: I'd rather we talked about it now. Is there anything you want me to do to improve my work performance etc.
Rick: No. Nothing at all. I know that you try your best and put a lot of effort in and you're keen to continue to work with us but...
John: ... but you're not keen to continue?
Rick: Something like that. There's nothing I can do John. I would love to keep you on but this is not the first time we've had customers complaining as well as other staff members about your performance.
John: So you want me to quit or do you want to sack me?
Rick: I think it would be best if you handed in your notice. That way we part ways amicably and everyone is happy.
John: Hardly a happy situation.
Rick: I know but my hands are tied.
John: Can I at least count on a good reference from you?
Rick: Yes, of course.
John: Thanks. I must say this is really disappointing and very badly timed. I guess I'll see you on Wednesday."

Rose: sure, I like them!
Amelie: it's quite interesting
Rose: it is, but also maybe a bit naive?
Amelie: Yes, like comparing Europe nowadays to Europe in 536 is a bit simplistic.
Rose: True, people had different expectations then, perceptions, believes etc. Also imagination of what was possible or not.
Amelie: Exactly!
Rose: Like the volcanic eruptions they read as the anger of God.
Amelie: on the other hand, we have this kind of people here and now as well.
Rose: Good point. They vote for Trump
Amelie: So maybe it's not that stupid, the article. Maybe we've never changed, as humans
Rose: At least not as much as we would like to believe.
Amelie: Which is a beautiful but also sad realisation.
Rose: Look at all this racism and xenophobia around the world right now. If not even IIww and Holocaust has changed us, what could?
Amelie: nothing, I am afraid.
Rose: We just keep repeating the same stories all the time.
Amelie: Over and over again.

Victor: Haha. It's the same with me.@2
Victor: I appreciate the possibilities which I would get.
Victor: After all British universities are far more prestigious than ours.
Victor: But I just wouldn't be able to overcome the homesickness and missing my family and closest friends.
Tom: Poland is not so bad of a country.
Tom: Our generation has pretty good perspective right now.
Tom: Life here can be great too.

Tom: I wasn't ready then for such step.

Victor: On the one hand, she would like to leave in order to gain vast knowledge and study on higher level
Victor: But on the other hand, she doesn't want to leave family and friends.
Victor: She's afraid she won't be able to handle life on her own yet.
Tom: Oh, I know this feeling. But you won't be able to help her. She has to make that decision alone.

Rob: The meniscus is the soft cartilage between your knees. Actually, we have 2 of them. Well, one of mine is damaged and needs to be removed.
Gina: Have you signed up for surgery?
Rob: No, not yet. I checked out 1 hospital and they told me the earliest date they have available is in the year 2022...hehe.
Gina: What? Are you serious??
Rob: Yeah, I know, it's crazy. I'm thinking of going privately.
Gina: How much would it be privately? 
Rob: 5000
Gina: That's not too bad. I mean, it's a lot, but not outrageous.
Rob: Yeah, I know. Plus I can always get a small loan and pay it off slowly.
Gina: Better than waiting till 2022. Is it painful?
Rob: I have no idea. It would be arthroscopic surgery, so it's minimally invasive, I guess.
Gina: Ok, that's not too bad. My uncle's had arthroscopy done. He was out and about 2 days after he got out of the hospital.
Rob: Hmm... that doesn't sound too bad. I've read a lot of blogs on it. Everyone says something different.
Gina: I don't think you should worry too much about it. What can happen if you don't do anything?
Rob: Well, it could get a lot worse, damaging other parts of the knee. Plus I avoid certain movements now. I'm afraid of the knee locking up, and that's PAINFUL!
Gina: That's not good. Just sign up for the surgery. I can help you out a little with the cost.
Rob: It's ok, don't worry. I'll go to the bank and get a loan.
Gina: The interest's going to be high. If I lend you a little, you won't have to borrow that much.
Rob: That's really nice of you. I'll think about it.

Todd: I'm not worried about it too much. This place is expensive.

Lonya: And we are. But you are always in a crowd of foreigners. Taking the same pictures. Buying the same things. Going to the same restaurants... So predictable! So artificial...
Lonya: In one respect we are different: we hardly ever take selfies! Just look at her:
Lonya: <file_photo>
Lonya: And she went on like this for half an hour or so. Oblivious to her surroundings. She probably didn't even know where she was!
Kitty: And where was she?
Lonya: Tulum temple on the Riviera Maya. Every structure rebuilt for tourists like her. Nothing here is authentic.
Lonya: <file_photo>
Lonya: This side is in its original condition. Can you see what I mean?
Kitty: Yes, I do but would't hold it against them. At least you can see in the reconstruction what these temples looked like. Otherwise you'd be visiting only heaps of rubble.
Kitty: Of course we have in Europe a different attitude to ancient monuments but who knows? Maybe Mexicans are right and not we?
Lonya: I'm not sure. I'll think about it.
Lonya: Maybe what I object most to is the fact that they don't explicitly say it's reconstruction. Seeing my first Maya temple I was in raptures until Thomas showed me those that haven't been reconstructed and explained the idea behind it.
Kitty: Oh stop it Lonya! Just enjoy your holidays and stop philosophizing. 
Lonya: You are probably right.
Lonya: It's not that much left of it. 10 more days. Somehow pity but I'm also looking forward to being back at home.

Sarah: sounds cute
Tommy: you wanna know the twist?
Aidy: bring it on
Tommy: there are 2 factions - one want's to talk about the future of the coven and are toward more civilized methods, the other is actually totally possessed by demons and wants the other half to sign a pact with them or - if nothing else works - kill them in the end.
Connor: Cool. Does the 1st faction have any suspicion about what's going on?
Tommy: Many people do, but it's not immediately known
Aidy: Hm, might be a bit unbalanced - the 1st faction might be weaker than the 2nd
Sarah: what about a 3rd faction to balance it out?
Tommy: like what?
Sarah: demon hunters in disguise?
Aidy: So then the duel is between the demons and the hunters and the people are still kinda weak
Tommy: They're still mages they can do a lot.
Connor: I don't think the first faction would be weak - it all depends on the mechanics of the game.
Connor: ytou could just as easily make the demons weak, depends on the design
Tommy: these are good point's though, I'll think about it. Would any of you be interested in helping me write it?
Sarah: I might help a bit.

Eve: Haha, Nat! :) Let me be clear - the final exam date is the 7TH of APRIL, no extensions are to be approved after that
Nathalie: PHEW! THANK YOU! I was about to collapse here
Eve: no problem, happy to help! What other assignment are you talking about?
Nathalie: Do you remember when I broke my leg and had to have a really intense physio? He agreed for me to hand it one of the papers by the end of the semester 
Martin: Do you need it? I'm sure he won't remember what he read...
Carol: I could use some better grade on one of mine... do you think I could resubmit it?
Nathalie: I'm not sure. He was pretty reluctant to let me do it but I bored him with some lines from the uni constitution and he eventually caved ;)
Carol: well, maybe it's worth a shot...
Eve: A little of top: the second floor in the library is being remodeled or sth and it's going to be inaccessible the entire week starting Monday so if you need anything you still have tomorrow to check it out!
Martin: Damn, I better make my way over there tomorrow, I misplaced my copy of his recommended reading list, does anybody have it?
Eve: I know it makes me sound like a nerd - but I do, I will forward over to you:)
Martin: But you are OUR nerd, Eve, so that's okay :) saving us yet another time
Carol: do you think it's bad i haven't ready any? how important are they for the final?
Nathalie: I heard from the previous years that he always scores better if you imply you've read it. Not sure you can pass without having read them...
Martin: Carol, I will be in the library all day tomorrow, something tells me I will see you there :)"

Rob: You all fancy pizza for tonight?
Steve: Hmm, not sure, I'll ask everyone.
Rob: OK.
Steve: Well, Mum would like fish and chips, Karen wants a Chinese meal and me and the kids are fine with pizza.
Rob: OK, that's awkward! Can you persuade Mum or Karen to change their mind, I really don't want to go to 3 places!
Steve: Just asked, Karen says pizza is far too carby and thinks Chinese is better in that respect, Mum doesn't like pizza much but could stand some Chinese food.
Rob: We have a very difficult family! Ok, I'll stop at the 2 places. Right, what about orders?
Steve: Right, me and Danny like pepperoni, Suki wants a chicken and bbq sauce pizza, Mum wants lemon chicken and special fried rice, Karen wants chicken with mushrooms, spicy veg and plain rice.
Rob: OK, sounds clear enough. Now, what time do you want to eat?
Steve: About 6/6.30?
Rob: Right, I'll ring and go get it at 5.45ish. Oh, just remembered, the pizza place delivers so I only have to visit the Chinese place! Got any wine or other drinks?
Steve: Umm, no, actually. Could you get a couple of bottles of white wine and some sugar free squash or pop for the kids?
Rob: Well, that means I still have to go to 2 places! Can't you or Karen go?
Steve: Oh, well, we've already had a couple of beers each, it is the Christmas hols, you know!🎄😁
Rob: I suppose I have to stop and get the drinks too, then 😒. Some bloody relaxing holiday for me!
Steve: Don't be arsey, you only see us all a few times a year! Look, how about you and me popping down the pub tomorrow?
Rob: Maybe, but you can pay your rounds this time!
Steve: Well, I had no cash on me at Easter! Only a one-off!
Rob: It'd better be! Make sure you go to the cash point before we go out tomorrow! Oh, and I will want you or Karen to pay your share of the take away this time!!!!
Steve: Don't get stressed, bro! See you this evening, bye!"

Josh: Write your own one.
Frank: Nevah!
Josh: Lazy writer!
Frank: I found the tutorial super helpful so I assumed that the manual would help me to get everything out of the zing.
Josh: Only casuals read manuals, truly hardcore people just click randomly on buttons hoping they'll achieve what they want!
Josh: That being said, I can't remember the last time I read a manual before working with a new software
Josh: I do look up stuff in manuals when I'm stuck with an option but I usually don't read them
Josh: Too lazy to do that!
Frank: Well, that's what I usually do. :D
Frank: But I did something manually yesterday and as I found out there's an easier way after googling a bit, I decided that manual it is. :D
Frank: I think Scrivener would be way more fun when starting a project straight in it!
Josh: That's just a hint that you should start a new project from scratch :P
Frank: Oh, the rest of my projects are WAY less refined atm. :D
Frank: Book 2 - 15 pages of notes.
Frank: Everything else 1-2 pages of notes per project.
Frank: Naturally I started from the biggest one. :D
Josh: Who wouldn't?
Frank: Anyhow, I like how ze zing will compose my project into proper novel form when I'm finished.
Frank: Also it seems to have GREAT script-writing tools.
Frank: So when I finally get to the movie project, it'll be easier to do.
Josh: The only question that remains is where to find the time to do all this?
Frank: I'll cut down my Desktop Dungeons time 50% and I should have enough time to finish a book per month. :D
Frank: I realized that I waste a ton of time playing some pointless flash games, etc.
Frank: Although Desktop Dungeons is a ""proper"" game. :D
Frank: Difficult as fuck but fun!

Mandy: Well, I didn't actually buy it, dad.
Roger: No? 
Mandy: I won it.
Roger: Really? 
Mandy: Yes. in the Company Christmas party.
Roger: How did that happen?
Mandy: We had a cheese tasting competition. One of our clients is Eurocheese, and the boss thought it was a good way to cement the business.
Roger: You had to guess the cheeses?
Mandy: That's right. Three rounds. In the first round everyone took part, there were ten pieces of cheese marked one to ten, and you could see them and write on your piece of paper what you thought they were. 
Roger: What happened then?
Mandy: The second round was just the best ten of the answers from round one. The cheeses were rarer so I don't think they wanted to give out too many pieces of them. Stuff like Wensleydale, Tilsiter. There were only five and I can't remember them all.
Roger: and what about the final round.
Mandy: That was the best three from the second round, with blindfolds on, up in the front. Three cheeses to guess with no clues.
Roger: And you got them all? 
Mandy: It was not so hard. I knew what cheeses they were selling hardest so it wasn't too difficult to second guess what would be in the final. Chevre, Port Salut, Stilton.
Roger: So you won first prize?
Mandy: No, the two runner ups got these stiltons for Christmas, I was one of them with Tracey from accounts. Dan won and got a whole cheeseboard.
Roger: Still, joint second is a very good achievement, isn't it?
Mandy: Yeah. Especially given the fact that I can stand the stuff and never eat it.
Roger: If you guessed them all, how come you didn't win first prize?
Mandy: Dan knew the full name of that chevre cheese. "

Heather: No, but I heard that you can buy them from Costco for like 40 per ticket.
Izzy: Ok, I'll go online and let you know. I just hope it doesn't rain. When it rains, they usually close down the rides.
Heather: Oh, that sucks! Why do they do that?
Izzy: They're probably afraid of lightning strikes.
Heather: Are we taking your car? It fits 7!
Izzy: Yeah, we can save on gas. Plus, the parking is extremely expensive.
Heather: What is it now, 20?
Izzy: Yeah, unless they increased it since last year.
Heather: Ok, we can split it, of course. 
Izzy: OK, we'll be ready before 10. I'll buy the tickets from Costco. I see that they're available. At least we can save a little. At the entrance it's like 55.
Heather: Ok, hey can you print out my tickets. I don't have ink for my printer.
Izzy: Yeah, sure. Just send me the PDFs once you buy them.

13819187,"Victor: Hi everyone! I guess it’s time for a debrief
Victor: We’ve organised an event, started promotion two weeks before it started. 27 People registered in total and 21 showed up in the end
Victor: I tend to think the event itself went smoothly and the speakers performed well.
Victor: There was some engagement between the audience and the speakers, although for the future I would try and think of strategies to foster more engagement
Victor: Few people showed up for the drinks afterwards, which personally surprised me because that was the part we actually ended up advertising the most.
Victor: And when it comes to our performance as a team, I’d say everything went smoothly! If I had to think of things to improve though, I’d say that we could communicate more swiftly and that info necessary for the event to go ahead as planned should be shared so that if one of us happens to be unavailable, busy, etc. others can swiftly take his/her task over.
Victor: I’d be happy to know what your thoughts are 🤗
Tony: Heyyyyyyy
Tony: I agree with you on everything lol
Tony: Yer, for the future it’d be good to start promotion beforehand. I’m actually still surprised that so many people came in the end
Tony: The point about sharing important info is very much to the point
Tony: ⚫️⚪️
Alice: Hey! Well, thanks to Tony for his relentless efforts to promote the event via Twitter. I’ve followed the “campaign” and think it was really good
Alice: I don’t take the thing about info and being busy personally, although I have to recognise I did withhold some info that was much needed and my timing wasn’t very good either.
Alice: I can take care of setting up a google sheets document where we’ll be able to put important info to be shared w/ other committee members
Alice: What do you think?
Victor: 🤩 That sounds terrific actually! Thanks
Victor: And no worries, this was our first event so we knew from the start it couldn’t be perfect
Alice: 😊
Victor: Well, I think we can congratulate ourselves both on the event and on the nice and fruitful debrief 🍒🍌🍉🤣
Alice: We sure can. Thanks guys

Olly: o, didn't he want to refurbish that old nightstand? wouldn't a grinder be useful for it? I don't think he has one.
Stacey: yeah nice idea - they're quite affordable actually <file_other>
Steve: approved. What about grandma Jean?
Stacey: Well, I was thinking we could buy her like a pass for several visits to this massage therapist she likes so much. You know she has back problems and loves visiting that lady, but she doesn't really have the money to do it as often as she would like to
Stave: great idea
Olly: think so too, she's gonna love it

John: Does it do anything? Like pump water, spin, wash?
Fiona: No. Nothing at all. Just the F8 fault on the display.
John: OK. Give me a moment I'll check the workshop manual and get right back to you.

John: Still checking. Give me another 10 min or so.

Fiona: But when we bought it I asked if you'd cover the repairs and you said yes.
John: That's right. But it is a return to base warranty.
Fiona: This makes it very awkward as we don't have a van to transport it and we really need to get it fixed ASAP as I now have a months worth of dirt washing.

Sam: Probably.

13816865-1,"John: Hey, James. found accommodation?
James: I am looking for an apartment to rent. what about you?
John: Yes me too.. Since my parents’ house is so far away, I need to find an apartment closer to school. I thought you were going to stay at the school dormitory.
James: I still have not decided whether to stay at the dormitory or not. I am looking at different options to find the cheapest lodging.
John: So, what are you looking for?
James: All I need is a place big enough for my bed, my desk and my television. 
John: Me too. 
James: How long have you been looking?
John: I just started this week. Since school is going to start next month, I figured I better start the process as soon as possible.
James: It is not easy to find an apartment to your liking that does not cost a lot. I 
John: Really? Is it that difficult to find an apartment?
James: No, it is just that everything I like so far is too expensive and way beyond my reach.
John: Is it because they are very close to school? I heard that the closer they are to school, the higher the rental cost.
James: Maybe that is the problem. Since I do not have a car, I need to find something close to school. 
John: Have you thought about sharing an apartment? If you want, we can find a two bedroom apartment and share it. It may be cheaper that way.
James: That could solve our problem.
John: Wait! Maybe we should talk this over before we decide.James: Right. For this plan to succeed, we need to come up with some sort of agreement or set of rules.
John: Here is my first question: What do you do during the weekdays?
James: I have to go to work from 8:00AM to 12:00PM, and then I have school from 1:00PM to 5:00PM. After that I plan to go home, eat dinner, and work on my school assignments. How about you?
John: Well, I have class from 8:00AM to 10:00AM, and then I go to the library to work until 2:00PM. After that, it is school again until 4:00PM. I plan to stay on campus until 6:00PM to work on my computer projects, and then go home to work on my other classes’ assignments.
James: It is my turn to ask the second question. Do you plan to have your friends over at the apartment very often?
John: No, not on weekdays. I want to finish my homework during the weekdays as much as possible. I think half of my weekend will also be reserved for homework. If my friends do stop by, it will probably be during the weekend.
James: Good, I plan to do the same things during school time. I also plan to visit my parents during the weekend. My mom is a great cook.
John: My parents’ house is too far to visit once a week. I will go home to see them and my little brother during the holidays. I need to be happy with whatever foods I cook.
James: It seems that sharing an apartment with you may work. Do you want to try it?
John: Yes. Let’s go in and take a look at this one."

Luke: That's another thing. But that's also democracy.

Luke: Well,,, seems like everyone would like to have their own kind of democracy.
Jack: The arguments they used were so absurd!
Luke: I was laughing with Maggie.
Jack: You were laughing. I was paralysed. I couldn't believe my ears.
Luke: Do you know that they are not alone in thinking that way?

Luke: Better sooner than later. Though I doubt it.
Jack: Why?
Luke: They feel good in this situation. They don't see anything improper, illogical or unethical in it. 
Jack: That's madness.
Luke: Just face it. They have such a comfy life right now. Never before has it been like that. They will not suddenly vote for someone who will deprive them of those priviledges. Would you?
Jack: I would think. THINK. That's what I'd do. Think for myself and not what they want me to think.
Luke: Well, you and I, the likes of us are in the minority now. 
Jack: :-(

Diana: The one on the Pygmalian?
Larry: yeah
Diana: haven't started it yet.
Larry: ok. what about the hemingway essay?
Diana: er, i think i wrote something along the lines of: ""Throughout the book, it can be observed how the lost generation struggles to overcome their experience with the war"" 
Diana: then i listed a couple of examples
Diana: and THEN i compared those characters to Robert Cohn
Larry: not bad :)
Diana: then I think i ended it with: 
Diana: ""However, in the last few lines of the book, we can see a change in Jake Barnes, the narrator of the book. This is especially noticeable in when Lady Brett says: ""... we could have had such a damn good time together."" This quote suggests that Lady Brett is still focused on the events of the past, which prevents her from persuing happiness. Jake, on the other hand, replies ""Yes, isn't it pretty to think so?"" - a quote which suggests that he has accepted his past and is now looking towards the future.
Diana: It still needs a little polishing though :)
Larry: Has anyone ever told you that you're really good at this kind of thing? :)
Diana: I just pay attention and take notes. Sparknotes help ;)

Carter: do you need help?
Scarlett: Exactly, I'm looking for some panellists, people with names and knowledge about the topic
Carter: I will ask Pieter Judson, he's very popular now
Scarlett: The historian?
Carter: yes, it's him, he teaches in Florence, Italy now
Scarlett: This would be perfect, he is quite famous now
Madison: oh yes, I've read recently his book about the Habsburg Empire, his claims are fascinating 
Carter: they are, and it's so well written!
Madison: yes, very readable, not academic at all, like a good novel
Scarlett: Could you summarise his claims shortly? I need to know what direction this is going to be able to create a coherent panel. 
Carter: So i would just call it very anti-nationalist. He doesn't believe in nation states and presents the Habsburg Empire as a kind of a predecessor of the EU.
Scarlett: which is not a good prediction for the EU
Carter: not necessarily, Judson suggests that the Habsburg Empire didn't have to collapse as it has been presented so far
Scarlett: by the national historiographies of the successor states?
Carter: Yes, they present the empire as a ""prison of nations"" that had to fall and had been collapsing for a while.
Carter: Judson argues that it was not the case. It is a narrative created post factum 
Scarlett: ok, this sounds fascinating.
Madison: I think you will find a lot of scholars ready to discuss with him
Carter: Sure, and it can be one of the best panels at the conference, easily
Scarlett: Great! So will you talk to him? I have some funding of course to pay for the flights etc.
Carter: Perfect! I will talk to him and let you know
Scarlett: Thanks a lot girls!"

Jake: Gosh! True! We'll talk about it. Now we have to get Pa thru' this medical thing. You have to! I had an impression talking to him yesterday that he prefers you to be present rather than me or Lawrie. Fair enough!
Mia: That's because we visited all those doctors together before. I simply have a good understanding of his condition. And I've also coordinated all his appointments. No worries - nothing personal.

Jessica: Honestly? I think it was awful really
Robert: That bad? but they serve pizza
Jessica: Their problem is that they serve everything. They have pizza and kebab and some Thai and Chinese
Robert: Hm, it does sound weird. I just saw that they have pizza
Jessica: Probably the owners couldn't agree on the cuisine. I don't know, but the result is awful
Jessica: I went there with Mary and basically nothing was good. I had a pepperoni pizza and a drink, she ordered something Thai, I don't know what it was, but she said it was terrible
Robert: Eh, I was hoping that maybe we have a decent restaurant nearby, at last!
Jessica: Don't you like La Toscana?
Robert: I do, but it's just one restaurant in the neighbourhood. I love pizza but not that much
Jessica: Ok, I get it. I don't mind as for me Italian cuisine is the best cuisine in the world ;)
Robert: It's great, but it's quite surprising that there's no Chinese or Vietnamese nearby
Jessica: You sure? I think Greg was telling me he's ordering his favourite nems and he doesn't live that far away from us
Robert: Interesting... I need to talk to him then, I googled for restaurants with delivery but nothing came up
Jessica: Maybe they don't have a website? Or didn't pay Google to advertise them? I don't know how it works
Robert: Hm, maybe, thanks Jess! I was really close to inviting Gemma to that new place
Jessica: For a date? Oh my, that'd have been disaster"

Magda: Are you going to that party through the city center?
Piotr: I don't know yet, I have to agree with a friend
Magda: Aha
Piotr: But I think we will go around anyway
Magda: That is good
Piotr: And what did they say on the news? Are they fighting with the police already?
Magda: There were no excesses for now, they only burned a few flags
Piotr: Cool. It can't be a Polish party without a few burnt flags :)
Magda: For me patriotism is an overused word. Instead of whatever this march cost, they could have built some library or a public object...
Piotr: Why have a library when you can have people marching the street and having fun
Magda: It is so embarrassing. But it is the same, every year
Piotr: Adults participating I can even understand, but young people or families with children? It makes no sense
Magda: It is basically asking for something to happen to them
Piotr: I don't think anything will ""happen"", but it is brainwashing since young age...
Magda: Supposedly Antifa also had a march. What a circus
Piotr: People are bored and stupid
Magda: I can't wait for this day to end. I always get upset
Piotr: That is why I don't read the news for a few days before and after :)"

Joanne: You may have a point there. What do you think we should do as a hobby?
Patricia: That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.

Isabella: my solution for that: ONLINE SHOPPING 
Ava: yeah, that can be better instead of walking around a million stores, but I don't really like online shopping either 
Isabella: How come?
Ava: Because I like to see what I'm buying, and you just never know what something will actually be like in real life
Isabella: Yeah, that could be the problem with clothes, but usually other stuff seems fine for me
Ava: Yeah, I guess it just depends. But anyway, I'm writing because I wanted to ask you if there was anything specific you'd like this year. I don't want to buy you something random that you don't need. So let me know if there is anything specific you need and I would be really excited to get it for you.

Jacob: where is the border then?
Elisabeth: I believe that the border between them is the river Tisa.

I mean, I know we mentioned it at the meeting, but there isn't much to go on, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to do... :(
Pierce: Oh, yeah - that was during Logan's presentation. I think it confused all of us, tbh.
Gabriella: Exactly! I like the guy, but he's so...
Pierce: Scatter-brained? All of the place??
Gabriella: You took the words right out of my mouth.
Pierce: I sometime think it's his convoluted plan to get to the top.
Gabriella: Seeing as he was just promoted recently, you might be on to something.
Pierce: Wasn't Wayne supposed to get that promotion though? Or have I missed something too?
Gabriella: Yes, he was! Poor Wayne - I think everyone feels sorry for him.
Pierce: So what happened? Oh, and here are your notes:
Pierce: <file_other>
Gabriella: Thanks! :) 
Gabriella: That's the thing - No one really knows. I thought for sure that Wayne would get the position and if not Wayne, then maybe John or Sarah.
Pierce: John and Sarah were pretty strong contenders - you're right. This whole situation is a little strange.
Gabriella: Not much we can do about it though. 
Gabriella: Sorry, I've got to go - I only have 5 more minutes before I'm back to the office.
Pierce: That's okay, I was taking too much time of your lunch break.

Thomas: Maybe Sicily? This island is truly amazing
Susanne: I start to think that every region in Italy is amazing.
Susanne: But what would you like to do? More culture or more beach? or food tourism? Any special needs?
Linda: haha, everything. Sicily is beautiful but we were there already 2 times, so some change would be nice. 
John: We want to rent a car, so some remote villages and pristine landscapes would be appreciated 
Thomas: If not sicily I would go for Puglia
John: Where is it?
Thomas: The heel of the boot!
John: interesting! Whats there?
Thomas: it's a big region with a lot to offer. The coast is mostly rocky, but very blue and clean. They also have amazing wines and probably the best olives in the world.
Susanne: The olive groves are so beautiful, very picturesque!
Linda: Would you recommend any particular places, towns?
John: So far I like the idea very much!
Thomas: Bari, Polignano a Mare, Monopoli, Lecce - but this one is not on the coast
Susanne: but I love Lecce, so nice, baroque and calm!
Thomas: And you have to go to Alberobello, a famous town

Papa: Yes, if you could pay the GP bill, it would be very helpful. As for the chimney sweep, why don't you ask Ms Shottner, if he'd been there or not.

13828862,"Robin: Appologies, it really irks me
Olive: Fair enough :P So what else do people do that ""irks"" you?
Robin: at work? general bitchiness and a lack of common sence, having to clean up after the previous shift because ""it's not my job"" even though when i do the shift its my job
Robin: ironing as well, now i was brought up wash clothes, hang them on the line let the wind air them and gravity dop creases outt, then ron them, i got chewwed out because i told the lass on nights there were shower curtains on the line, she throws a wobbler about hos its always been my job and she does more work than me and stewart, it was 5 curtains and she'd have finished all her jobs thor the shift in an hour and a half easily
Olive: You really hate your job, don't you... :(
Olive: Do any other employees feel that way though?
Robin: the jobs not bad its just some of the people i work with, yes me and stewart are in the same boat
Robin: he's former rhodesian counter terrorist police, also did firearms for movies like the expendables with schwartzneiger
Olive: And he hates it too?
Robin: has the same irks, sometimes the job is ace, the guest can be great and being aknowleged by them either with a card or tripp advisor is ace
Robin: i just hate what amounts to sexism
Olive: Sorry mate :( Wish i could help
Robin: i'm alright - just nice to chat with someone from time to time...
Robin: Like apparently the cleaners and female night staff have been placing rubbish on the floor to see if I've hovered up, the woman on nights wasn't impressed when I hadn't ironed wet shower curtains fresh out of the wash. She's the one who apparently ""does more than we do on shift"" yet she wont do paperwork that she'd throw her dummy out if it hadn't been done for her 
Robin: And my manager supports her whole heartedly
Olive: Fun fact - the cleaning ladies tick was something that mistresses would do in Victorian times to make sure that the servants were doing their job properly.
Olive: One such trick involved hiding a coin, under a rug - if the servant gave the money back, she was trustworthy. If the servant took the money, the mistress would know. And if the servant missed the coin completely, she clearly wasn't doing her job.
Olive: Now that I've gotten that (interesting, but completely useless) fact out of the way, I think the only thing I can say is: hang in there. Or better yet - don't give them (aka your boss) a reason to fire you.
Olive: Right now, you're in a tough situation because you need the job more than they need you - so, even though it's unfair (and I completely agree with you btw), the only way to win the war is to not let them get you down.
Olive: Man... I suck at giving advice.
Robin: Completely useless information is always useful for pub quizzes, flattered, deffinatly go with flattered
Olive: What about the remainder of my answer... ?
Robin: the advice is good, and your right I just need to push through it, as for military I've not a clue, run with the pups try and rehabilitate my joints and see if theres any career I can do, although im also looking at museum's as a possible career 
Olive: That could be fun - it's interesting, right? :D

Jane: what did you tell her?
Kate: that we're comfortable in our mess <3

Kate: she's now going around the department telling everyone that she used to think we're better than that
Jane: lol than what exactly? It's not her business if you have a mess in your room or not, she's not your manager
Kate: i know, right?!
Kate: I don't get what she's thinking
Jane: I think she's just frustrated, idk

Jane: I don't think we will
Jane: better safe than sorry though, we have to watch out ;)
Kate: but we did tidy up a bit

13680759,"Alan: Hi Rob.
Rob: Hi Alan.
Alan: You know what, I have got a new business idea.
Rob: Another website?
Alan: No, this time it's food related.
Rob: Another hamburger stall?
Alan: No, it's fruit sushi.
Rob: Fruit sushi?
Alan: That's right. I have been trying different combinations of rice, fish and fruit to make sweeter versions of some traditional sushi specials.
Rob: You have already tried making these sushi?
Alan: Yes, I've got about twelve different recipes for maki and nigiri featuring slices of pear or guava alongside the other elements. Less fish, and not every fish seems to like it.
Rob: OK, well you could try it. Take a stall in the middle of a mall corridor, get a certificate for HACCP and see if it takes off.
Alan: But it's all oing to cost quite a lot of capital outlay. I reckoned about 30,000 dollars to get going and I can only put in ten. Would you be interested in lending me some start-up capital?
Rob: If you can find 20 people to put in a thousand each, then I'll be one. How about that?
Alan: I have done a business plan and the possible upside if it catches on is tremendous
Rob: What's the  margin and the volume of sales you reckon you can get off one stall?
Alan: I reckon it's going to be about a thousand dollars in gross profit every day, once it gets going. And that's conservative.
Rob: Well, send me the numbers over. I might stretch to 5,000 if it's really convincing. But no abandoning it when you get bored like you did with the camper van renovation business
Alan: well that business was just a hobby. It was never going to make much money. 
Rob: Well that's not quite what you said at the time. 
Alan: OK, well I'll send you the figures and you can see for yourself if I have left anything out.
Rob: Alright. I will have a look at it later in the week. A bit busy right now.  "

Kirsten: just tell us a little bit ;)
Hannah: Okay, so you know we've been there for 2 weeks. It was this beautiful house just 5 minutes away from the shore. We went to the beach almost everyday and you wouldn't believe how clean and warm the water is there. Just wonderful.
Patty: And were was it exactly?
Hannah: It was near Malaga, but not exactly in the city.
Patty: oh, cool, I've been in Granada one time, that's more or less the same region.
Hannah: Yes, it's super close, I've visited it as well.
Kirsten: And how did you get to live in the housre?
Hannah: airbnb
Hannah: but lemme tell you it wasn't easy to find the perfect spot. This house had a great location and was generally very cozy, but it was kinda old. Could have been renovated imo
Patty: but still 5 minutes to the beach <3
Hannah: that was just the best part. I don't remember the last time I was so chillaxed B)
Kirsten: but you said you also visited other places?
Hannah: yea, we took several road trips like the one to Granada, I mentioned. We went to Almeria, Gibraltar. There was this national park we also visited. Generally wasn't all lying on the beach (though for the most part it was ;) )
Patty: sounds soo relaxing...
Kirsten: And were the people ok?
Hannah: They were THE MOST friendly people I've ever met in a foreign country. But it was a good think we knew a bit of Spanish, because most of them - especially the older generations - don't speak English even a tiny bit.
Patty: Yeah, but I remember they're very willing to communicate even if you don't know their language.
Hannah: That's true. Basically I recommend it a lot. Anyways, I hope we'll see each other this week - I'll write you in a couple of days with the details ;)

Mona: It's high time to add something awesome to my cooking repertoire
Tina: Aight, I think I can help you
Tina: The first and the most difficult part is to prepare the dough
Mona: Actually I've got some experience with making the dough
Mona: I've done that many times before for my mom
Tina: So you know the basics. But the pizza dough is specific
Tina: You'll need: 250 grams of wheat flour, 150 ml of warm water, 2 spoons of olive oil, 4 grams of yeast, half a teaspoon of salt and the same amount of sugar
Tina: You can also add 2 spoons of mixed herbs to that, but it's optional
Mona: Good cuz I have everything besides the herbs!
Tina: Awesome, so now the instruction. Ready?
Mona: Ready!
Tina: Pour the flour and yeast to a big bowl and mix them well
Tina: Now add the olive, sugar and salt and mix again
Tina: Now, while kneading the dough you need to add water little by little, until you get, say, a ball of dough
Mona: Got it! I guess I should leave it for some time to rise, right?
Tina: Exactly. Half an hour should be fine
Tina: Use this time to prepare all ingredients that you'd like to put on pizza
Mona: Olives, salami, onion, chicken... Yummy!
Tina: Ok, now smooth the baking sheet with a bit of oil and form the dough on it
Mona: Done
Tina: Time for tomato sauce and all the ingredients you've prepared.
Tina: Did I tell you to preheat the oven to 220 degrees? If not, do it now
Tina: Put your pizza in the oven and wait more less 20 minutes. Check how's the baking going from time to time, maybe you'll have to get it out of a bit earlier

Kirsty: It all went well, didn't it? 😉
Juan: Big applause for all of us 👏 
Danny: 😂
Kirsty: Frankly speaking, it seemed quite easy. I feel much more confident now about the events we'll be organising later on
Danny: Yeah, I thought it would all be much more difficult and, of course, that at least one disaster would befall us at some point, which fortunately didn't happen
Juan: It all went smoothly indeed. I think enough people came as well. The only thing I'd wish for would be better networking... But I guess the quality of event attendees is not really something you have much control over anyway lol
Kirsty: lol you're too critical! Some people were nice 
Juan: 🙊
Danny: Ha ha well, it all goes down to promotion strategies, doesn't it? Next time I'm sure we'll have more time to promote the event on social media, and we can target the audience more consciously
Juan: 🔫
Kirsty: There you go... ha ha
Danny: I was a little surprised by the fact that people were so eager to leave us after the talk ended
Juan: Yeah, they seemed to literally hate the idea of having a beer with us
Kirsty: That's Free Will for you... They loved ❤ acting against their own interest
Juan: Ha ha, yeah that happens. One of these guys we did our miserable little networking with has written to me - inviting me to request a fellowship which is COMPLETELY unrelated to what I'm working on
Danny: Lol, don't forget to reciprocate
Kirsty: Absolutely, don't forget to suggest he applies for a fellowship in a subject opposed to his
Juan: I'm so rude, I just intended not to answer 
Kirsty: Anyway, I'm quite proud of us I must say. We've done a terrific job
Danny: You sound like Trump
Kirsty: Ha ha well then, ""Congratulations guys, you've fulfilled a truly reciprocal undertaking""
Danny: LOL
Juan: 😂😂😂😂
Kirsty: I've had to use a dictionary for this. Anyway THANK YOU
Juan: It was a pleasure ✨
Danny: Yep. Looking forward to the next event in March. As far as I understand, Margaret has basically finished organising everything, so our role is to sit and enjoy

Alan: I don't know. Laughter is the best medicine?
Simon: Yeah, that's a good one. It's not exactly going to do much against bubonic plage is it?
Alan: Not really. Doctor, I have these swellings under my armpit! That's alright I'll tell you a joke.
Simon: Any more?
Alan: A stitch in time saves nine. I don't understand how you can stitch time in the first place, and why it should save nine instead of seven or eleven, for example.
Simon: That was the original title of the Outlander novel, you know?
Alan: What ""A Stitch in Time saves Nine?""
Simon: No, just ""A stitch in time"". That was what Diana Gabaldon called it. Later on they changed the further issues of Book one to Outlander and called it the Outlander series and the TV shows were always just called Outlander.
Alan: About the best historical drama ever made, in my opinion. Really insightful about the eighteenth century. You can almosot feel as if you have lived in it.
Simon: I agree. The only better series I know is Breaking Bad, but that's a completely different genre.
Alan: Both BB and Outlander are hard to cast when it comes to genre. I would say they transcend genre. But you are right, they are very different. 
Simon: which do you like better?
Alan: I would still say that BB is the single best TV series ever made, and that by a wide margin. However, once you have seen it from beginning to end and you know what is coming, you don't want to watch it again.
Simon: Right. Whereas you can watch all the Outlander series several times just for the historical insight and the atmosphere as well as the artistic beauty of the scenes and cinematography.
Alan: Yes and Catriona Balfe
Simon: Indeed. There's nobody on Breaking Bad who quite equals her, is there?
Alan: I quite liked Marie Schrader and Jessie's girlfriend who chokes on her own vomit, but Skyler is not exactly my type:
Simon: No. And anyway none of them can hold a candle to Catriona. 
Alan: She's a gorgeous woman and a fantastic actress.

Martin: How about I take you to lunch on Friday? 
Susan: OK, 1 o'clock?
Martin: That sounds good. What kind of food do you like?
Susan: Oh anything. I am not fussy.
Martin: Maybe Italian?
Susan: Well, I actually have a gluten intolerance so pasta and pizza are both off the menu for me. That makes Italian a bit tricky.
Martin: How about Thai?
Susan: I get a bit of a reaction to spicy food, maybe something less hot?
Martin: There's a great new Steak House on Station Road, they do really good rib-eye steaks
Susan: We can do that if you want, but I'm actually vegetarian.
Susan: Except for chickens. Chickens are OK
Martin: There's a nice Vegan place doing vegan sushi on London Road. How does that sound?
Susan: That sounds perfect. I have an allergy to soy and peanuts, but probably I will be able to find something on the menu there. 
Martin: OK, then. It is called Edamame. I'll meet you there on Thursday at one.
Martin: Will you be able to bring the book you talked about, that you were going to lend me?

Victoria: Haha, you're welcome! :D I can't wait to read it. xx Let me know when it's finished? xx
Kitty: Shall do! :D It might take me a while to sort out the details though, but all will come in good time :)
Kitty: Out of curiosity, did you add my story to the community ""The Best, funny and Romantic fanfiction""?
Victoria: Haha, no I didn't. :L Congratulations! :) xx
Kitty: You didn't?! Then who did? I guess I'll never know. Thanks, by the way. :)
Victoria: It's a mystery. o.O And you're welcome. :)
Kitty: Oh, I read some of your stories - not bad! I like 'Housemates' and 'The Vagabond Opera' (found them interesting) :)
Kitty: Also, because I'm in a promoting mood, I figured you might like my other story: ""Don't you dare!"" That is, if you want to read it :)
Victoria: Oh noees, I hate those fics. D: I'm currently trying to co-author with a friend, but it's her birthday today, so we haven't got much done. :P Still, it's a lot better than the crappy fanfiction I've got up here at the moment. xx
Victoria: I'll give it a read right now. :) xx

Kitty: Is this with the Marauders?? Or am I wrong?? Well done at getting 5000 - that's quite an achievement!! xx
Victoria: Thanks :) The most words I've written for a story is 9000, so I'm pretty concerned. D: No, it's Harry travelling back in time. We wanted to write something with lots of hippies and stuff. XD There's the Marauders in it, though. So far I've just been writing the prologue and stuff. xx
Kitty: Ah okay. Does Harry meet his parents or should I just wait and see? ;) 9000 compared to my short capters (them most I've ever written was 859 words) is a lot - at least to me :) xx
Victoria: Haha, yes he does. ;) I'm not good with sticking with things, so I just tend ot give up halfway through. :P I love your short stories, they're so good.
Victoria: But my co-author is killing me! So far, she has done a spectactular zero words. I'm busting my ** off over here, and I've a ton of History exams and crap to prepare for. She's just had her birthday, so I can't really complain, but I've nearly got 7000 words now and my brain seriously hurts. D:

Max: Take her to the bowling alley, fun's dead certain :D
Logan: Max's got a point, and it's a really good one
Logan: And don't even try to look for excuses, it's within a heated area, you can order drinks and food at the bar and they play good music in the background
Adam: Hmm
Adam: Actually I remember Nelly saying that she used to go bowling with friends when she was in college

Myron: I'd like to go somewhere if we manage to scare up some fellows hungry for adventure
Ruth: Ok, would you rather go to some place in Poland or abroad?
Myron: I think we shouldn't go abroad yet. We can find a nice place in our country, see how we get on and maybe the next year some longer distance trip :)
Tina: Hi :)
Tina: I agree with Myron, his vision sounds reasonable.
Paula: And so do I, hello :)
Paula: I'd also like to put forward a proposition
Paula: Let's go to Masuria! We can rent a big car, get everything we'll need and have fun at the lakes!

Anna: 2 years...

Anna: Well, he's happy for me, of course, but I can that he's worried.
Anna: He didn't tell me not to go.
May: Can't he go with you then? It's just two years.
Anna: We discussed it already, but to make things worse, he got promoted.
Anna: Geez, I feel bad for saying that, because it's great that he was promoted, but now he's not going to leave his company.
May: Don't they have a branch in Thailand? Or somewhere near?
Anna: No, they don't. He said he'll wait for me, but 2 years is awfully long.
May: I know, I understand :(
May: Maybe I'm being too simple and straightforward, but I think that either you're up for a long distance relationship or you are not.
Anna: I don't know to be honest...
May: Uhm, what do you not know?
Anna: If I go it may destroy everything. We'll see each other maximum three or four times...
May: Yeah, ok, I understand, but are you afraid you'll stop loving him or something?
Anna: No, but what if he meets someone else?
May: I'm pretty sure it may happen even when you're here...
Anna: Thanks May :P

13829200,"Carol: Best greetings to you from Mexico!
Carol: <file_photo>
Mary: Oh my gosh! So you are travelling again. What is it like there? How long are you staying there?
Carol: Yes, Will insisted on a couple of months in the tropics before his hip operation, so we decided to go full bore and try again something rougher. So far everything's been going smoothly.
Mary: Isn't Mexico a bit dangerous? Have they got good medical care, just in case?
Carol: We are in Yucatan only, which is pretty touristy and they put great store on safety as tourism's their major source of income. As for their medical services I do hope we won't have to try them out. Besides we both have  our foreign travel insurances with a guarantee of immediate transport to Europe, if need be. Fingers crossed!
Mary: Good! And you are extra careful too, I hope.
Carol: But of course! We've rented a car to be independent of their erratic public transport and they seem to have a good network of fairly good roads. Mostly empty, sometimes even overgrown by vegetation on the sides.We never travel after dark of course.
Carol: <file_photo>
Mary: Good Lord! It looks like a narrow tunnel through a dense jungle! Any big animals?
Carol: They seem never to clear the sides of the roads, so the verges are kept clear of vegetation only on busy roads with much traffic. But most of their roads are like this, no one in sight for miles.
Carol: <file_photo>
Mary: Would suit my driving!
Carol: It soon becomes deadly boring. We tried to keep ourselves entertained by keeping the radio on and picking up as much Spanish as possible but it turned even a greater bore! 8D Anyway we're not overdoing it with driving. So much to see around!
Mary: Mayan monuments?
Carol: Caught you here! Had made the same mistake myself. We've been instructed to say ""Maya monuments""  as the adjective Mayan refers mostly to people and their languages.
Mary: Ooops! Once a teacher, always a teacher.
Carol: :‑P No pro! Anyway we've been visiting all sorts of Maya monuments, mostly temples, but I still know precious little about them. Our guidebooks are worthless, only this touristy crap.
Mary: Oh don't be so critical about them. They are destined for different readership. You'll catch up when back home.
Carol: I hope I will! But with Will's operation looming over us, I might find it difficult. The thought about it seems to be bogging us down even here, but we avoid talking about it.
Mary: Oh Carol! Stop worrying! It is a standard operational procedure, one of the most common surgeries. William is fit and has no known ailments that usually beset men of his age. It's going to proceed without any complications. Take my word for it!
Carol: Thank you, Mary. I surely trust your opinion, after all you are a doctor. But you know what it's like.
Mary: Of course I do and I do understand you are upset. But please don't. Just enjoy your holidays!
Carol: You are right. We'll make the most of them.
Mary: And take care too!

Jane: Wow! Thanks Dave!
Dave: No problem. I'm happy to hear that someone's considering adopting a dog instead of buying one.
Jane: I thought about buying, because I love pugs and other small dogs. I was reading about them and I found out that they have a lot health issues.
Jane: I don't want to buy a dog that's going to die in three years or I spend all days at the vet.
Dave: It's actually proven that mutt's have much better health than purebred dogs.
Jane: That's why I've heard too. So I thought it may be a better idea to adopt :)
Dave: See, I've always dreamed about a German shepherd, but then I went to the shelter with my friend and found Trixie :)
Dave: Adopting a dog is not as easy as it may seem, but I think that's good. I was asked to fill in a questionnaire, had two interviews (;)) and a trial walk, before they agreed to give me Trixie. So be prepared to have your flat checked and everything.
Jane: I don't mind that at all.

Jane: I'm only afraid they won't let me adopt a dog, because I've never had one.
Dave: Oh don't worry about that! I didn't have one either!
Dave: Go to the webpage I sent you, or a find a different shelter, and look at the dogs that are waiting for adoption. We all have our preferences, but I advise you to be honest with the caretakers and tell them what kind of dog you would like to have.
Jane: Thank you! What if I like a dog that will not be suitable for me?
Dave: Hm, I'd rather go for the personality than for the looks, same with people I guess ;) I'd prefer my friends to be nice than pretty ;)

13681784,"Melanie: You mentioned this chutney with green tomatoes yesterday. Have you got a recipe? Have you ever prepared it?
Tracy: Hi Melanie! It was delicious. We had with venison at my daughter's. No, I've never prepared myself, she did. Amelia.
Melanie: Do you think she'd share the recipe?
Tracy: Oh I'm sure she will. She'll be proud to. Shall I ask?
Melanie: Please do! I'd appreciate it.
Tracy: Hi Melanie, just talked with Amelia. She said the green tomato chutney is just like any other chutney, only you add green tomatoes. That's it.
Melanie: How about proportions? How much tomatoes and how much onion and other ingredients?
Tracy: I think she said tomatoes come instead of 1/4 of apples.
Melanie: So it's not only tomatoes?
Tracy: Of course not. It would be just bitter. I think.
Melanie: Do I have then to pre-prepared the tomatoes? I suppose they're quite bitter when green.
Tracy: You're right. I'll ask her.
Melanie: Maybe she's got a recipe written down or something?
Tracy: Sorry for not answering at once! So busy now. So I asked Amelia about green tomatoes for chutney and she said she didn't as you say pre-prepare them. But they are always her own tomatoes, from the garden, and she has these sweet cherry tomatoes.
Melanie: A! That makes a whole lot of difference! So I'm afraid I can't imitate her recipe :(
Tracy: She's send me a link to BBCFood. They have wonderful things there. I'll forward it to you.
Tracy: <file_link> Green Tomato Apple Chutney.
Tracy: But look! They have tomatoes and apples half and half. Different than Amelia's. But I'm sure it'll be good as well.
Melanie: Thanks a lot. I'll have a look at it.
Melanie: One more small thing: does Amelia take lemon and orange zest??
Tracy: I don't think so. No. I would've tasted that. No, definitely not.
Melanie: Great thanks Tracy! Off to the kitchen then!
Tracy: Good luck!"

Tammy: Who usually buys the gifts in your family.
Millie: Ronnie loves buying presents for the kids. He usually picks them out so meticulously.
Tammy: I do all the buying in my family. Hank's usually busy with work at this time of year. It's so interesting to see how shopping's moved to the net over the years.
Millie: I know. I remember like 10 years ago, no one would have thought twice about choosing clothes by just looking at the pics online.
Tammy: Toys are a little easier. I mean, obviously there's no difference between the toy at the store and the one on your screen. Plus, you can do your shopping in pajamas!
Millie: True. But it's kind of sad how everything changed in the last 10 years. It's such a short span of time. There's just something about shopping around the holidays, there's a certain magic in the air, you know what I mean?
Tammy: I hear ya. But I thought Ronnie does all the Christmas shopping :)
Millie: He does, but you obviously I have to pick out his gift :)
Tammy: Speaking of Ronnie, what are you planning for him this year?
Millie: Well, I was thinking of a nice watch? What do you think?
Tammy: I'm sure he'll love it. I'm buying my beau a new toolkit. He's been kind of hinting at it for a long while. Where are you guys going for Christmas this year?
Millie: We're going to Hank's for Christmas Eve and then we're going to my family the next day. A marathon, like usual!
Tammy: That's the thing about the holidays, you wait for them, but then you're glad their over :)
Millie: I just hope it snows this year. It seems like it's been a while since we've had snow in Dec.
Tammy: I don't mind not having any, actually. It makes driving so much easier, you know.
Millie: I usually drive more than you during Christmas ;) Your family is all in one city!
Tammy: Yeah, but you wouldn't believe the traffic in the city. Once you leave out on the highway, you leave all the traffic behind. Speaking of traffic, I'm stuck in it now. Actually, I shouldn't be texting you now. I gotta watch it for cops

Elton: First, you need to send us a copy of the receipt, you can do this online, detailed instructions are on our website.
Boris: Of course, what’s the second step?
Elton: More complicated, it requires you to show up in our store.
Boris: When?
Elton: We process your application in 5 business days and then a manager will contact you to organize the meeting.
Boris: Will he call me or send me an e-mail?
Elton: We prefer calling, as it is easier to communicate and go through all details. You can choose your preferred way of communication and set up the times you’re most usual available to talk.
Boris: That’s ok, I just don’t check my e-mail so often, that’s why I’m asking.
Elton: No problem, as I said the form of communication is up to you, don’t forget about it while sending your application.
Boris: It will be somewhere in the options?
Elton: Yes, all the steps are explained in details on our website.
Boris: Great, so how does the meeting look like?
Elton: While processing your application we will check the video footage from the shop, trying to find out how many products you bought.
Boris: I understand, but why am I needed?
Elton: If it’s confirmed, just to sign the documents.
Boris: And if it’s not?
Elton: Then the manager will explain you further steps.
Boris: If you don’t agree, will it go to the court?
Elton: As the last instance, yes, it may happen. But we always try to resolve it in a different way.

Sid: You forgot what happened last year when we were all supposed to come in and clean up the Museum after the repair work?
Anne: True, she didn't turn up
Sid: and didn't even tell us she wouldn't be there.
Anne: Well, she probably will resign from the group now
Sid: Quite frankly, it won't upset me if she does. We need to have people who will do things and not just make work for other people by having ""good ideas"".

Sid: I have no interest in a situation where you and I do all the work and other people simply take the credit. I don't find it motivating.
Sid: I don't care if she is offended and I don't care if she leaves. 
Anne: But at least she is positive about things and not like that Halina. 
Sid: Yes, she is more of a glass half empty than half full person, but she does chip in, if not with time, then with money

Shirley: You should. You fucking should. The way he talks to her it's just so patronizing, I just couldn't believe she lets him do that.
Barb: so what does she see in him?
Shirley: Well... have you checked him out on fb?
Chrissy: on it
Shirley: so he has this ""my-daddy's-rich-I'm-gonna be-a-lawyer"" vibe. And I guess he's rather good looking.
Chrissy: <file_photo>
Barb: ok, I see he's probably considered attractive by most. But he has this asshole-pretty boy face, which is a total turn-off for me
Shirley: he is an asshole pretty boy
Shirley: but he seems rather normal at first and then he opens his mouth
Barb: you think it's gonna last?
Shirley: you know Kim's attracted to assholes. He's not her first. But I do think we need to talk to her. I encourage you to go and meet this guy so we can all discuss it with her.
Chrissy: sounds like an intervention
Shirley: a much needed one

Mummy: At least you had sense enough not to try to get the car out.
Andy: Totally impossible. Maybe Lennie will try to clear the drive this afternoon.
Mummy: Well, you will need the car to do the shopping, won't you?
Andy: Dunno really. It's Lennie's business. I think he'll have it all done by home deliveries.
Mummy: Isn't he a bit too easy going with your money? He doesn't earn that much himself.
Andy: I don't mind at all. We've got more than enough anyway. He bought a Xmas tree yesterday and it's on the terrace now.

Mummy: We are very happy about it as well. Dad has already bought our rail tickets, with place reservation. By the way, don't bother about picking us up from the station if the weather stays like this. We'll take a taxi.
Andy: Not a bother at all! By the time you're coming all that snow will be gone.
Andy: Hey Mummy. I'd better stop texting now as I still want to have a bite before getting back to work. I'll call you tonight, ok?
Mummy: Oh, is it your lunch break?! I thought you were back in your office by now. Sorry to have kept you! My poor hungry son!

Tanya: We've been having below zero temps since Friday. Aiden hates it! No snow, everything frozen stiff, grey and uninviting. Show me some nice sunny views!
Linda: <file_photo>
Tanya: How wonderful! This being...
Linda: The area is called Riviera Maya. It has fantastic beaches, as you can see, but no easily accessible coral reefs. We've done some snorkeling though, just in front of our hotel's beach that has an artificial reef. Not bad at all!
Tanya: What the hell is an artificial reef?!
Linda: Rows of clay half-round structures, open at the top. After some time they become so overgrown that they nearly look natural. Fish don't seem to mind.
Linda: <file_photo>
Linda: Not very best these photos but you can see what I mean. Water temperatures are 24-26 C, so perfect for us to swim. There are also natural coral reefs along the coast here. We can even see them - Arrecife de Puerto Morelos - but they are either nature reserve or you have to be taken there by boat. I would be tempted but Peter says it's too expensive. I just think he's getting lazy.:(
Linda: <file_photo> Mark at his most active!
Tanya: Be lenient and have more understanding for his age! Can't you go alone?
Linda: Even if I go for a walk alone, he becomes fidgety after 20 mins. Yesterday before sunset I went towards a stretch of wild beaches, no hotels, to pursue my favourite hobby here - collecting seaborne rubbish, and were back to him after half an hour or so, and he was nearly angry with me for leaving him alone. What a bore!
Tanya: And your accommodation? It's a fashionable area, isn't it?
Linda: The hotel, or rather a resort, Vidanta, is idiotically luxurious. But we are coping!
Tanya: Don't make too many sacrifices.
Linda: <file_photo>
Tanya: A paradise as artificial as those coral reefs.
Linda: Spot on! Being here you just switch off any critical thinking about environment, social justice, all that crap. More food wasted here in one day that people eat in some neighbouring village in a week. Kilograms of foodstuffs used solely as decoration. Hectolitres of water pumped through enormous swimming pools...
Tanya: Heated, I presume.
Linda: Oh no! We are environmentally friendly and let the sun warm the water. Bullshitters! But of course I can't talk about it with Peter. He loves it here.
Tanya: And you should too! Look, it already exists and your small protest won't change anything. Just enjoy as long as it lasts.

Paul: How many people, where do we want to go (have you found some places already?), timetables, breaks, places to eat
Retha: Lol I know almost nothing
Paul: Seriously! The trip is in 6 days!
Retha: I know but I got sick, I tried but it didn’t work, that’s why they gave it to you
Paul: Right, sure, I’m sorry
Retha: I know it shouldn’t be like that, I really care about this initiative
Paul: That’s OK, our student research club is only growing, that’s why we need this trip, to get to know each other
Retha: And I absolutely screwed up, people paid and nothing is arranged!

Lily: I will do couchsurfing there (you know it?)
Mia: Never heard about it
Lily: Google it. It is a way of travelling. People can host you for free and you spend time with them. I did 2 weeks in Sicily this summer doing only couchsurfing
Mia: That sounds so great, what do you mean by spending time with them, like company? Or do they show you places and walk with you around?
Lily: You spend time, cook together , walking travelling,  partying.  It all depends on a person . Sometimes they don't have much time. All depends on a person
Mia: That sounds so much fun, for free, i will check it out, i actually love traveling, but well done, hope you enjoy it, i heard its amazing
Lily: Yes, it was awesome. Usually, people travel in 2- it's safer. But I love traveling alone 😉
Mia: I wish one day i can do the same, thats awesome, really ☺️
Lily: Yes but you need to be careful. Weird people are everywhere
Mia: Yeah that's not surprising nowadays, unfortunately

13612055,"Susan: Hi Bill. I'm looking for a vacation home for August. Lila said you had some interesting ideas...
Bill: hey sis. yeah we went last year to that little place in Italy, near florence. Rented an apartment. was cheap as hell but location was not for everyone
Susan: why so?
Bill: away from the sea. like in the very middle of the country. No beaches. 
Susan: why would you go to Italy and not have a beach?
Bill: we wanted to be away from the crowds. place had a pool and it was drivable everywhere interesing. Like a couple of hours to florence, rome, an hour to the beach if you needed to.
Susan: pool would make up for much, true. but Italy in august?
Bill: hot as hell, but with the pool and AC it was nice. and full wine season. 
Susan: we would be going with the whole lot, the 4 of us and the dogs. do they take pets? did you take Sparky?
Bill: yup. no problem with the dogs, although you have to be careful not to let the dogs roam around the pool. they got very angry once, when we just let Sparky out and he jumped the fence. But yours are tiny. Fat, but tiny.
Susan: cannot imagine them jumping the fence. Any fence. they have trouble to get on the couch. 
Susan: I keep telling the kids not to overfeed the dogs, but you know how they are, as soon as I turn around...
Bill: like you don't give them treats at the table :P
Susan: shut up!
Bill: anyhoo, we drove, with sparky and the kids, much cheaper. And you need the car when you're there. It's like this little village in the middle of countryside. vinyards and olive trees. and crickets.
Susan: drive there? how long?
Bill: two days, we drove through Germany and Austria. Made an overnight in the Alps. 8 hours to Austria then like 6 hours to the place in Italy. 
Susan: seems not that bad. 
Bill: wasn't. and the place being so cheap we could afford three weeks... 
Bill: it was like half the price of a hotel. We cooked ourselves or went out for dinner. nice little italian restaurants, great food. we even found a 2-star one in some little village in the middle of nowhere, can you imagine?
Susan: oh, nice. 
Susan: It seems like a good deal. I'll talk to the hubby. send me the details, okay?
Bill: will do. phone number - they speak english, and e-mail. better to e-mail them the owner responds on the evenings, during the day he's in the field with the vines and stuff.
Susan: great, thanks a mil!"
13681080,"Paul: So, what's your take on this caravan business then?
Bob: Very strange. Why are they only doing this now?
Paul: In what sense?
Bob: Why only now, with a very anti-immigration president, do they try to walkk in in large numbers. They had poverty and a desire to come to the US during the time of previous administrations, but only now are they coming in a big organised march like this.
Paul: I see what you mean. The timing is strange, and around the mid-term elections. but maybe it is because this is the last chance.
Bob: You mean before the wall is finished. I have no idea if and when they will actually finish all of that.
Paul: Probably they got inspired by what happened in Europe, how all those migrants got through into Europe and they are still there, nobody for sure knows how many.
Bob: Mayba, but this is a different country and the geograpy is very different. 
Paul: For sure they are getting a lot of help from someone.
Bob: It did look on the media as if ordinary Mexicans were helping them.
Paul: I have a friend down there, Raul, he tells me that nobody is helping them and that the pictures on the news of Mexicans helping out of the goodness of their hearts is just to make it look like Soros isn't funding it.
Bob: Presumably some Mexicans will be giving them some charity
Paul: Nobody. Ninguno. Nada. No Mexican is gonna give them jack shit because every one of them has a relative or friend who signed the proper application form and is waiting. They cannot stand these queue jumpers. If they were not being guarded by their organisers, the ordinary Mexicans would be beating them up.
Bob: Well it's interesting, what you say.
Paul: I just don't know what's gonna happen when they actually get to the border in big numbers.
Bob: We won't have long to wait before we find out. 
Paul: If we really do find out the truth.
Bob: I wish they had webcams along the border so that we can see for ourselves. I can't trust the media anymore.
Paul: You have to watch every side because they are all lying about everything and sometimes the truth is in the middle.
Bob: They even doctor the videos, and sometimes the videos are not doctored and the other side claims that they are.
Paul: We live in very difficult times. It seems to be difficult to be sure about anything."

Hayley: But wait, they have different last names, don't they?

Hayley: Have I ever told you that you should work for the CIA?
Ashley: LMFAO, u have, multiple times. xD

13682315,"Fitz: Hey, you wouldn't believe all the tricks Max is doing!
Vernie: Really? Like what?
Fitz: Well, he can fetch me my slippers, but that's only the beginning. Max can find my remote whenever I misplace it somewhere.
Vernie: How did you teach him that?
Fitz: Well, it took a while, but there's this cool website that shows tricks any dog can learn!
Vernie: So you're trying to make Max into your personal slave :)
Fitz: <File_video> 
Vernie: That's unfreaking believable!!
Fitz: Yeah, that trick took a while to teach, but Max is actually really really smart!
Vernie: No shit, you've got your very own Jeeves at home. I want one too :)
Fitz: Well, labradors are actually perfect for most of these tricks. I highly recommend one for you as I know your lazy ass will appreciate these 4-legged friends.
Vernie: How old is Max now?
Fitz: He's 3. 
Vernie: Do you have the number to the place where you bought him?
Fitz: Yeah, he's a purebreed so you're gonna have to fork over quite a bit, like at least a grand.
Vernie: I know, purebreds are expensive. But you know I was thinking of getting a dog for the longest time now.
Fitz: Yeah, sometimes I had the feeling you wanted to steal Max from me :-p
Vernie: Max is cool, but I'm sure I can find another just like him.
Fitz: Yeah, I'm sure you can. I'll go with you. Just call ahead and book an appointment.
Vernie: Ok, cool. Thanks."
13829267,"Anthony: Hello my dear Helen! After all these happy-new-year greeting it's time for a recap. Here is a bit of a pictorial review of my year (well holidays really) - interested?
Angela: Great to hear from you again and so soon. Sure I'm interested.
Anthony: Starting with kayaking in May, including Hetty, Ken, Joss (Hetty’s son) and Sarah on the team-sheet.
Anthony: 5 day’s kayaking, where we paddled from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, along the Caledonian Canal in Scotland. It is mainly Loch Ness and three smaller lochs, joined up by canal sections, and is about 65 miles long.
Angela: Ant the weather? Scottish?
Anthony: It was the most perfect weather ever (we have had that sort of a summer).
Anthony: <file_photo> and the most stunning countryside.
Anthony: <file_photo> The head of Loch Ness where we wild-camped in an idyllic bluebell glade. Yes this really is Scotland!
Anthony: <file_photo> Me being inert on Loch Lochy.
Anthony: <file_photo> And with Joss and Sarah.
Angela: Wait a sec!
Angela: I don't understand kayaking in these flimsy objects.
Anthony: They aren't flimsy having polyethylene hulls.
Anthony: And some photos from our sailing trip in The Hebrides:
Anthony: <file_photo>
Anthony: So my sailing trip was back to the Hebrides, but this time to the northern part. Again the weather and scenery were perfect.
Angela: Can't believe it! Looks absolutely stunning.
Anthony: In August I spent 23 days along the Silk Road, from Kyrgyzstan, into western China, then Takikistan and Uzbekistan:
Anthony: <file_photo>
Anthony: <file_photo> One night I woke up in my Yurt, to find this kitten snuggling up to me.
Angela: Looks as if you were about to take it along with you.
Angela: Did you sleep in yurts?!
Anthony: A marvellous trip through some amazing cities, and spectacular mountain scenery in hotels, guest houses, “home stays”, and camping in Yurts.
Anthony: <file_photo> And finally over Christmas in Morocco with Sarah and Zof.
Angela: Zof again? I wish you did!
Anthony: With Zof and her boyfriend plus Denis I had a week cycling on the Sahara side of the High Atlas mountains in Morocco. The cycling was a bit boring, but we went to some great places and had a great trip.
Angela: Very impressive. Thanks for sharing!!!"

Ireneusz: ok...

Sasha: ok I have a crush on Fabiano and I don't know if he's gay
Ireneusz: :O
Brygida: I didn't know you're gay
Sasha: do you know if he's gay or not?
Sasha: I don't want things to be awkward
Ireneusz: can't you just ask him?
Sasha: I feel awkward coming out tbh
Sasha: only my really close friends know
Brygida: even if he were gay, you work together so it will be awkward
Sasha: I don't want to ask him, he may say no due to fear or sth
Ireneusz: then come out and see how he reacts
Brygida: I don't think dating a coworker is a good idea
Sasha: but I'm really into him
Ireneusz: you are complaining about your job all the time
Ireneusz: this Fabiano crush could motivate you to work somewhere else
Brygida: and asking him out would be less awkward because it would be awkward dating and working together
Sasha: you're probably right
Ireneusz: and hearing no and seeing each other each day is shitty too
Sasha: I don't know I'm shy
Brygida: shy or not, you kept telling us that you wanna do sth else
Sasha: I'll think about it"

Ramsay: I kind of like them myself! Nostalgia and all that!
Julie: LOL!
Ramsay: I'm sure there are newer ones, I just don't know them.

Stanley: And how are you?
Pauline: I was at that conference today
Pauline: And I have to tell you that it's really dissapointing
Pauline: For example the catering case
Pauline: The restaurant owners decided that they won't open and when people responsible for organization convinced them, it turned out that it's really expensive
Pauline: Moreover when the conference was coming to an end, restaurant decided that the rest of the food that they knew they won't sell anymore will be given out for free
Pauline: So imagine that you bought pricy piece of cake and coffee and suddendly 3 hours later they give out for free remaining things
Stanley: A bit unfair
Pauline: And the presentations of lecturers lasted only 20 minutes each.
Stanley: Wow. That's quick.
Pauline: Definitely too little time. In 20 minutes they won't be able to even introduce their products :/
Stanley: On the other hand, you have to know what kind of mistakes are made while organizing such events. If for example you will ever take part in organizing a conference, you will be aware of things you should avoid.
Pauline: Exactly!
Stanley: :)
Pauline: I learned few things today. I'm glad i decided to come

Doris: Am with a lady friend of mine, German. A bit of hiking in the area but staying in one place. She's got her big dog with her and the beast is just divine.
Tress: Aren't you so lucky to be able to walk as women alone in parts of Europe? This is unheard of here.
Doris: This freedom of movement, also as a woman alone, driving or walking, city or countryside, this is a measure of a quality of life I take for granted in Europe. As much as I love being in ZA, I find it so difficult to cope with such restrictions. I love ZA dearly but I couldn't live there.
Tress: I assure you I hate it as much as you do but it's part and parcel of my existence, so I take THIS for granted.
Doris: Sure enough. When over there, I accept it too and adjust accordingly but in the back of my mind there's this feeling of discomfort.
Tress: What's your accommodation like? I've never been to France even.
Doris: Oh it's very very untypical. Here the link:
Doris: A group of Dutch who bought a huge piece of land and live off it. And of paying guests! Everything fanatically organic, environmentally friendly and sustainable. No mobile phones, no cigarettes, no non-biodegradable products...
Tress: Sounds a tough regime! Did they have a look into your travel bag? ;)
Doris: That's it! It's all based on trust. They ask you not to and trust you follow suit. You know they have a shop here, as we're miles away in the sticks, open 24 hrs, with food produce, cosmetics, preserves, postcards and that stuff. And it has an open till! You just take what you need and leave the money in the till.
Tress: No!!! Can you imagine anything like that in Khayelitsha?!
Doris: May be more in Khayelitsha that in a mixed race area?
Tress: Nowhere in this wretched country. Never.
Tress: Look what's been happening here. It's a clip from our local paper: <file_photo>
Doris: Oh no! Horrible HORRIBLE
Tress: Our daily news... So enjoy your European paradise Doris!
Doris: It rams it home how lucky we are here. Travelling freely from country to country, meeting freely whoever and wherever. No border controls. 
Tress: But different languages! I found it so confusing when we flew from England to Amsterdam, then on to Frankfurt and to Rome in the end.
Doris: But everyone speaks English. More or less.
Tress: But we two, speaking only English, felt a bit limited. Or it's just our lack of experience in travelling. So much unlike you!
Doris: Oh well... Anyway it's France now in a Dutch colony and there are at least 3 language in the air. It is Europe as well, I guess.
Tress: Lucky lucky you..."

Sam: Visiting profs have quite a nice time in Poland
Sam: Red tape is hellish
Sam: But you won't have much of it as a visiting prof
Sam: Which uni invites u?
Greg: I'll have to look up the name again. They sent a message after I was at a conference with their Chair or Vice-Chair, but I was afraid to just jump enthusiastically in.
Sam: Right
Sam: University and city matters and some faculties are more messy than others
Sam: But most Poles speak English so you won't have troubles communicating with tgem
Greg: Thank you <3
Sam: Warsaw, Cracow and Poznań are the best for foreigners
Sam: Poles, like Americans I guess, are pretty divided right now and you can feel the right wing getting stronger
Sam: if you were to move in here, I would recommend postpone it till 2020, till new elections
Sam: but for a visiting prof it won't be an issue
Greg: I'm such a chicken. I'm afraid of every town in the world.
Greg: Thank you. I'll have to pull it up and tell them I'm interested. I'll send you an update around the same time.
Sam: it would be great if u were in Warsaw
Sam: I just told my bf that you would have lots to talk about, he studied Chinese language and culture and we could hang out!

Chris: It's really slow right now. I feel so guilty when I don't have any work to do. Everyone else is so busy.
Kate: Yeah, I'd bet it's a really uncomfortable situation. Maybe you should mention something to your manager.
Chris: I was thinking about that. But I was thinking to hold off until after Christmas. I'll see, maybe things will improve. 
Kate: Ok, it's up to you. You know the situation best.
Chris: What would you do?
Kate: Well, they'll find out sooner or later. I mean, they just have to look at the logs and they'll know. It's better to come forward before they say anything.

Frank: then: ""Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined. Harpier cries, “'Tis time, ’tis time."" - I was thinking something like: ""Really? The hedgehog only whined once! Although this guy Harpier did tell me it was time...""
Alice: :D haha!

Frank: how bout - ""Lets make our potion and dance around it! I say we throw in that toad that's been lying under that rock for the past month - it looks poisonous!""
Alice: You're brilliant! (How on earth did you come up with that??!) 
Alice: ""Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and cauldron bubble."" - I wrote: ""Double the work and double the trouble, let this fire burn so our cauldron can bubble""
Frank: Very nice ;) I covered a bit of Shakespeare at Drama class. :) btw, you are getting this down right?
Alice: yeah - gotta say this is kinda fun :) we make a good team
Frank: as if there was any doubt ;) but moving on - i've got an idea for the next part:
Frank: ""Toad's not enough! We need to add more - pass me that a newt’s eye and frog’s toe. Maybe we can add some bat fur, a dog’s tongue... I also wanted the forked tongue from an adder, maybe lizard’s leg and an owl’s wing? That should do the trick! now our potion will truly be horrendous MWAHAHAHA!!!""

Mary: Good idea. Meanwhile, I'll do some research of my own.

Martha: I'm worried though because I still have no place to stay
Jay: Hm, are you looking for a flat, a room or student halls?
Martha: Honestly? I'd take anything at this stage
Jay: Have you checked if the university has a student accommodation programme?
Martha: Yes, they do, but it's only for full time students ;/ it's ridiculous, because I applied for the part time as I can't afford to just study, therefore I need to pay more for my accommodation. Fuck logic
Jay: Hah, seems like that, doesn't make any sense to me either
Martha: So I'm not entitled to any accommodation programme and I'm probably at the end of the list to get a room at student halls
Jay: Maybe a private one? How expensive are the flats?
Martha: Crazy expensive... I most probably can't afford it, but maybe it'll be possible to share with someone
Jay: I may ask around, I think I have some friends there, I can ask around, maybe they'll have a spare room

13828617,"Wolf: Hello dear Dieter! Just to let you know that we are flying over to Havana tomorrow and be staying in Cuba for 4 weeks. As far as I know the Internet is rather nonexistent there, so don't worry when receiving no news from us.
Dieter: Good to hear from you, Wolf. We thought you were already there. Yes, I know how difficult it is to go online in Cuba. But they do have so called hotspots.
Wolf: I understand these are just public spaces where you can get connection but you have to buy a credit that seems to be quite expensive. We will do that but not more than once a week or so.
Dieter: Don't bother then texting us. We'll catch up on the news later.
Dieter: When are you back in the online world?
Wolf: On 4 January. Cancun, Mexico.
Dieter: You have stamina for that travelling, old man!
Wolf: We've been taking it easy this time staying in places for a week at least. All has been working according to plan so far.
Dieter: Thanks for sending us an email with the update of your whereabouts. Fantastic pictures!
Dieter: Helen says it looks as if you both have lost some weight.
Wolf: Not really. Not yet. But surely we will in Cuba.
Dieter: ?
Wolf: Food shortages, food rationing, black market - you name it. We've heard the folks there are queuing for bread. They have restaurants though, but we hear the offer is rather modest.
Dieter: Sounds a bit of a challenge but it can't be that bad.
Wolf: Hope not. And losing a few pounds won't be bad either. And there is always Havana Club!
Dieter: Try the 7 year old one. To my taste it can compete with mid range cognacs.
Wolf: We'll try them all. Mary is also looking forward to trying out a Cohiba. If we can afford it!
Dieter: At Miller's they run 20 a piece.
Wolf: Out of question!! Better ways to ruin one's health.
Dieter: Come on! You are on holidays! Enjoy it and stop counting money. Cuba isn't that expensive after all.
Wolf: Wrong! Tourists are forced to use special currency and pay special prices. We'll see how expensive or cheap it really turns out to be.
Dieter: Anyway I hope you'll have a great time in Cuba. We wish you all the best for this lag of your journey.
Wolf: Thank you. We'll get in touch as soon as practicable.
Dieter: Happy trails!
Wolf: All the best to you and Helen."

Kamil: oh, and the famous beach place?
Kamil: Anca? any ideas?
Kamil: but we don't need to see all at once. We also need hints how to do it all cheaply 😂
Joona: Coney Island? The beach with the amusement park? It's cool, it's just off-season right now, so it's quite empty and eerie 👻
Joona: Ok, I'll think about cheap possibilities and ideas 🙂 Plus you'll nail Boston! (It's also an awesome city!)
Kamil: i think so!
Kamil: hmm, it's so much to see, but I would also rely on your opinions :) you've been there for a while
Anca: Oh god Joona, how nice to care for us lost people, facing the ultimate metropolis for the first time
Anca: If Kamil is afraid of Boston, I am afraid of being send back by the homeland security, as it happened to me in the UK before taking the Italian citizenship, so I still can't quite believe that I will get to New York 😅
Anca: But, just in case, I would like to do Moma and the empire state building, I am not sure about a show on Broadway. And I would like to see coney island out of season, as you might have noticed already, we like absurd things 😅
Anca: And the Brooklyn Bridge but I don't know, do these things need to be arranged, or one can just go? Moma for example, or the esb?
Joona: Well, maybe planned is a better word for it 😀 Like if you want to see a show on Broadway, queuing for cheap tickets is a special process. And Guggenheim, for example, is pay-what-you-wish on Saturday evenings, Whitney on Friday evenings - MoMA sadly is always the same price but I'll make some kind of list of things 🙂
Anca: So yes, we need some plans!
Anca: Oh thank you 😍 How is the weather? Decent?
Joona: At the moment it's cold and first snow came last week
Anca: In Bucharest as well
Joona: But decent, beats rain
Anca eui: So nothing shocking I suppose
Joona: No, just keep an eye out for the forecast before you leave to Boston as 1) it can change really quickly here 2) Boston can be extremely cold with the wind and all
Anca: So probably colder than NY? Ok, we will try to arrive there prepared
Joona: 😂
Anca: Ok, for now both cities are warmer than Bucharest. But the cold doesn't scare me too much
Kamil: I will buy new shoes😂 but that's great you know when and where are free options!🤩

George: Sorry!
Jane: It’s okay; I just want to get your thoughts on mom. Should we try to hire someone to look in on her daily? Move her laundry to the upstairs? What do you think?
George: I think we should definitely try to avoid having the laundry on a different floor or get a stair lift or something. Which is cheaper?
Jane: I think a stair lift is a few thousand, but so would a plumbing job and getting a stackable that would fit upstairs. About even, in other words. Not sure what she’ll go for. Probably neither!
George: She might go for the lift then. Keeps everything pretty much the same.
Jane: True.
George: What about getting someone to check on her?
Jane: I was thinking the neighbor. She’s retired and I’d offer to pay her to pop in once a day and have coffee, keep her company. Can you help out with the cash?

13611886,"Ann: I have got a plusnet mobile sim card that I pay 5.00  a month for it has 500 minutes, 100 more than the skype one, plus I have a decent phone that I can use with it, not my own
Rob: I think I should buy a number - such as 0333 and then redirect it to your mobile, which will redirect if no one answers (I think you can set that up on your mobile?)
Rob: We can then measure how many CS notepads call us and adjust the monthly package accordingly
Ann: Possibly as the main company number yes, but with my mobile number to call direct in office hours or text out of hours as they may not like calling a 03 number and getting replies from a strange mobile
Rob: possibility
Ann: Its worth just trying the mobile number at the moment maybe.  Does the 0333 number you have already belong to CS? Why can you not keep that number and just redirect calls from that?
Rob: 0333 numbers are mobile friendly, like 0800 numbers. I dont fancy adding a mobile on the site as it makes us look too small. I want people to think they are dealing with a larger business
Ann: Ahh Yes I didn’t think of that, it will be ok on my emails though? Rather than the skype one?  I do have a landline number that only gets used once in a blue moon, but that has a Gloucester code, I’m happy for you to use that  if that could be of use
Rob: Im setting up a new 0333 number - what is your mobile number?
Ann: That’s a very good question because until I get the phone unlocked I cant call to see what the number is and as I never used it myself
Ann: I ve been paying 5 a month for the last year but not used it.  So I will get it to you asap, I am going over to Tesco shortly and I can get it unlocked there hopefully tonight 
Rob: ok no rush
Ann: Did you sort out the Cawson invoice?
Rob: oh no good job you reminded me I will do it now
Ann: yes the files are on driver and I already have a template invoice set up for them, you just need to see haw many courses they took this month
Rob: I think they had quite a few this month, I need to get onto Chris Lamport and hurry up his reports as I cant send them an invoice if they dont have all the reports
Ann: Hes getting annoying being late with reports all the time
Rob: I'm thinking about cutting his jobs, hes getting a bit too comfortable
Ann: well that wont hurt for a while, he is taking more local tutors jobs really
Ann: I know its great that he is able to cover areas that we are short on but apart from that we should leave him to his own area

Izzy: They're probably afraid of lightning strikes.
Heather: Are we taking your car? It fits 7!
Izzy: Yeah, we can save on gas. Plus, the parking is extremely expensive.

Ross: And 1 entry is 75mins.
Ross: Whereas the pass costs 150$ for 10 entries, but OFC u have 2 pay in advance.

Ross: It lasts 6 months, so until March. 
Ross: Yes, the pass is valid 4 the entire season.

Bo: That might take a while. 
Steve: I'm listening. 
Bo: in general it was ok and i don't regret going, but there's a lot of things to work on. Like logistics - there was just chaos at every step before the larp - we didn't know where to go for accreditation, the organizers contradicted themselves several times
Steve: sounds bad
Bo: and there was a several hour delay at the beginning 
Steve: not encouraging
Bo: Yeah, but once it started it got better. You have to give it to them they really put a lot of effort in the props, the set and the costumes for npcs
Steve: any pictures?
Bo: I have several hundred actually, but I have to sift through them, so I'm just gonna upload them in a couple of days 
Steve: ok
Bo: and other players where generally good. Made a couple of friends there actually 
Steve: nice, do they larp outside their area? Maybe they could come to us sometime. We need some fresh blood. 
Bo: yeah, they're definitely interested and I'm pretty sure they have no problem traveling across the country for larps. 
Steve: great to hear
Bo: yeah, anyway there was also a group of orcs - I think they all new each other beforehand - and they were getting shit-faced every night, making lewd comments to girls and generally being assholes to everyone. 
Steve: shit, did you tell the organizers? 
Bo: yeah, I did, quite a few times, and they supposedly talked to them, but it didn't help at all 
Steve: too bad
Bo: if it was my larp I'll just kick them out and ban them from other events right after the first night of this shit
Steve: totally
Bo: And that was another thing I have a problem with - the organizers just weren't assertive enough with them. If a player ruins the game for everyone else you just kick him or her out, simple as that
Steve: You can always give them feedback about all this
Bo: I already did, cause they obviously put a lot of effort into this and just have to fix some things until next year. "

Jack: What happened???
Jack: Is everything ok??
Mia: Yes, all is good. We got our money back.
Mia: So we got approached by a ""friendly"" stranger on the street who presented himself as a teacher and built our trust by telling family stories.
Mia: Then he recommended us some tourists attractions i.e. The Happy Buddha and some ""excellent"" tailors, where they had the ""last day of promotion"" he stopped a tuktuk for us and verified the driver's license (another trick to build our trust).
Mia: The tuktuk took us to the happy Buddha. 
Mia: When we entered the temple we were approached by a very friendly ""Buddhist prayer"".
Mia: He said that he worked in London for the Thai trade mission.
Mia: He asked us what were our plans for the day and recommended that we went to the tailors showing us a few pictures of clothing that he ""ordered"" there for him and his wife. 
Mia: The tuktuk took us to the tailors were a pushy seller persuaded us to buy some clothes of ""very good quality"". 
Mia: As soon as we paid the tuktuk took us to the next tourist attraction but on the way we read the reviews on Google maps and we realised that we were scammed.
Mia: The reviewers were saying that once they ordered the clothes they were never sent to their country as promised or the finishing was very bad, definitely not worth the money.
Jack: Oh shit!! And you already paid!!!!
Mia: Yeah. We felt horrible!!
Mia: We asked the driver to take us back but he refused. Of course, he already got his commission.
Mia: We ran back to the tailors. Fortunately it wasn't far. Within 10 minutes we were back. We told the pushy seller to cancel our order.
Mia: He said it was impossible because the fabric was already cut to our measurements. 
Mia: When we asked to see the cut fabric it was nowhere to be found, as it was already ""sent to the factory"". 
Mia: Then we said that we were going to call the police.
Mia: Only then he agreed to return us the money.
Jack: What a story!
Jack: I'm glad that you managed to get it back.
Mia: Yeah. It's like 1500 USD!"

Jessie: Kind of. What about other cities?
Barbara: Ottawa and Toronto are already, although I prefer Toronto. Not too keen on Quebec.
Jessie: Oh, why is that? :o
Barbara: I don't know, maybe it's the French thing ;)
Jessie: Hahaha, I get that :D
Barbara: But to be fair it's a nice city, maybe just not for me. I think if I'd known French, it could have been different.
Jessie: I can relate. It's been exactly the same in Paris. Loved the city, but the whole experience was a bit weird with the waiters outraged that we didn't speak French.
Barbara: Kind of the same in Quebec then ;) Although they do have beautiful architecture and city landscape. If you have chance, go there, I'd give them another chance.

Jane: I was in the kitchen fixing drinks when Chris came in. We started talking, it was fun, but then he tried to kiss me.
Olivia: HE DID WHAT?!
Olivia: Are you sure?
Jane: Well yes, I'm pretty sure as his face was definitely too close to mine.
Olivia: But you said you don't know
Jane: We were drunk, I was drunk, he was drunk. That's why I don't know if it means anything, maybe he was mistaken.
Olivia: It's quite difficult to mistake you for Liz. He must've been completely smashed.
Jane: He definitely wasn't. We were talking, I don't know what's gotten into him
Olivia: I don't know and I don't care. I think you should tell Liz about this. Who knows if he's not cheating on her.
Jane: You think? I don't want to ruin their relationship. Nothing happened in the end.
Olivia: Duh, yeah, because of you
Jane: You really think I should talk to Liz? After I said no, he just walked away.
Olivia: It doesn't matter, he shouldn't have tried in the first place"

Selma: Good morning dad! but it's not your train
Selma: How was the flight?
Barbabas: Ours is just behind. That means we'll be 20 mins late too. Good old DB!
Selma: maybe not, there's 20 mins between them
Barbabas: So so. In fact pretty uncomfortable. Hardly any legroom, impolite staff, terrible food, dirty loo... The usual.
Barbabas: Hope it won't increase.
Barbabas: Is everything alright at home?
Selma: old aircraft?
Barbabas: Just the opposite! We flew to Cancun in some old lemon and it was roomy as in the good old days. This flight was on a brand new airbus, with seats squeezed and small as for kids. Scandalous, if you ask me.
Selma: sorry for you, so you both pretty tired?
Barbabas: As hell pumpkin! Mam is just dozing off. At least our trains are still comfortable.
Selma: first class?
Selma: was it late after all?
Barbabas: Of course not. Too expensive.

13821364,"Ivan: I am really concerned about the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
Ivan: Do you thnik that Putin could openly invade a neighbouring state?
Vasily: I understand and share your concerns, Ivan.
Vasily: First, the Crimea was taken over by ""Little green men"" who were in fact Russian soldiers.
Vasily: Second, Russian troops were sent to occupy Donets Basin to the east of Ukraine...
Vasily: All this may spell serious trouble...
Dimitri: That's true gentlemen, the situation seems to be getting more and more tense every month
Dimitri: Vasili haven't mentioned the most recent accident in which Russian coast guard ships fired on Ukrainian navy vessels near the Kerch Strait
Ivan: This is actually what I was thinking about when I started this conversation.
Ivan: But the circumstances of the accident are not completely clear.
Dimitri: Yes, there has been a great argument over which side is responsible for this accident.
Vasily: I'm not entirely familiar with the accident at Kerch but common sense tells that Russia is to be blamed, as usual...
Dimitri: Indeed, this is what most people have already assumed.
Dimitri: However, in this particular situation it might be the Ukrainian side that initiated the conflict.
Dimitri: In fact, it enabled Petro Poroshenko to declare martial law in Ukraine, which may be a political gimmick beneficial for him in terms of the forthcoming presidential election in 2019.
Ivan: Wow, this would be a perfect example supporting the idea that politics is a dirty business...
Vasily: My God, but if it turns out to be true, the safety of entire state is at stake!
Dimitri: It should not be a surprice if I told you that the interests of oligarchs have been always more important for the people dealing with politics in Ukraine then the good of the state itself...
Vasily: It is ubelievable that such things still happen in the 21st century, wow.
Ivan: Yes, and ordinary people, lives of millions of innocent people are meaningless in this game...
Dimitri: This is a very sad conclusion but, to be honest, it has been like that since the history remembers.
Vasily: Very sad vision, indeed. We can only hope that the future would be better time to live.
Ivan: No more and no less..."

Mary: especially the Camino de Santiago
Jenny: yes, this is surly pretty cool, but I don't think we have enough time to do it in one trip

Mary: right, so it makes sense to come back to the coast after Madrid

Jim: but what is also very interesting is what happened afterwards
Jim: when they abandoned the project, criticised it and most of all the new project - Skopje 2014
Jenny: I heard it's horrible
Jim: it us a nightmare. So Skopje transformed from a city that was planned to have the best architecture in the world to a city with arguably the ugliest, most kitschy buildings
Jenny: this story sounds very interesting indeed.
Jim: yes, but maybe it would be good for another exhibition
Jenny: maybe"

Omiko: Hi! Yes!
Marika: Can you send me their name or address?
Omiko: It was in Żurawia street, but I can't remeber their name, nor the exact address.

Wanda: You're a lot braver than me, I only went about 15 miles to Leeds.
Helena: Yep, you didn't move out of West Yorks even!
Wanda: Well, I prefer it! I can even go and work in the petrol station till 10pm and pop home on the late train if I want to, saves me food money to have a day or two of home cooking, plus it's a lot nicer.
Helena: I know what you mean! I can't be arsed to peel veg and stuff like that, I exist on take aways and convenience micro meals, not good!

Helena: 🤣I have had one, but Edinburgh is a bit posher than Glasgow where it's more popular. Do like square sausage and cloutie dumpling, though!
Wanda: You'll have to initiate me into these delicacies when I come visit.

Jen: Did you guys spend the night there? 
Lorrie: Yeah, we went there Fri night and we got back today. I know Niagara Falls is a little cliché, but :)
Jen: I'm so happy for you!!! So, when's the big day??
Lorrie: We haven't decided yet. Probably spring or early summer, but I'm starting to panic already!!! The venue, dress, cake, band...
Jen: If you want I can help you plan everything!! I helped plan my sister's wedding and she said I should be a wedding planner LOL
Lorrie: That would be amazing! I need someone like you. I have no idea where to start.
Jen: Well, first you need to book the venue, and I mean like ASAP
Lorrie: I know, I know. Remember that nice place near Old Mill? I'd love to have it there.
Jen: Wouldn't we all! That place probably costs a ton! We can try if you want, though. It's good to have a few places picked out, then we'll start calling.
Lorrie: That's what they say. Can you come over tonight? I'd love to get a heads start on it.
Jen: Sure, you can tell me all the details of last night too!!
Lorrie: :) Wouldn't you like to know. Do you know where The Keg restaurant is? It's overlooking the falls. But he didn't propose there. He was very discreet about it. Actually, I was surprised that he didn't do it there until he surprised me in the hotel room.
Jen: You know Jack, always full of surprises. So, he proposed in the hotel room, did he get down on one knee?
Lorrie: Yes, but I'll tell you all about it when I come over, ok?
Jen: Ok, ok, I'll be there after dinner, probably around 6
Lorrie: Ok, I'll be waiting. If you have something to drink, bring it over.
Jen: Ok, see ya.
Lorrie: Bye"

13731489,"Henning: You wanna hear something weird?
Max: yes, always!
Henning: Recently somehow we talked about waiters/waitresses. And the Louis's interpretation was that in Italy they are so nice, because they are so lowly and cannot afford to be demanding and have to be servile, basically.
Henning: And in France they are arrogant, because they can afford it.
Henning: Somehow, because their status is higher.
Max: LOL. Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.
Henning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.
Max: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well
Henning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.
Max: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.
Henning: Berlin is a big city though
Max: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid
Henning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.
Max: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.
Max: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city. 
Max: Especially between societies as diverse and generally as similar as France and Italy, just think about Genova and Nice!
Max: just bullshit! Luis is so communists but keeps blushing conservative and nationalist stuff.
Max: And in Poland they are sometimes super nice - new American-style capitalist and servile and sometimes the ""communist"" remnants.Throwing your plate in front of you with a hostile ""proszĘ"" with a long accent on the hiper-correct ""ę"".
Max: And then one is confused about his/her judgements and builds new ones. But maybe we just don't need to read everything through this national framework. I agree that there is a lot about it, or about culture/climate/language/whatever, but we just exaggerate all the time.
Max: even me! The single biggest anti-nationalist of Europe 🤣
Henning : Hehe, you got passionate!
Max: a bit"

Franklin: Wow, the heady heights of management, Ellie. Spare a thought for us poor sods glued to our phones all day, won't you?
Ellie: Of course I will. I started there too 10 years ago, not many of the old gang left now. Brits took their jobs, I expect!

Franklin: Wow Ellie, didn't expect that! Umm, yeah, if that's OK with everyone.
Ellie: Why not! I 'm always bringing friends home, you'll be sorta exotic to them!
Franklin: They obviously don't get out much! I'd really love to come. Next Thursday, isn't it.
Ellie: Yeah, bit of a drive, but we can leave Weds after work, get there midnight. Bring warm clothes though, it gets mighty chilly up there by the lakes.
Franklin: Yes, of course. I mean, Chicago isn't exactly tropical, is it?! 
Ellie: Fair point!  See you at the gym? We'll have an OJ or two?
Franklin: Love to! I like going to the gym instead of the pub after work, a lot healthier!

Brooke: I cried while reading both of them. But they moved me in a different way.

Debbie: I'm not. She is showing already.
Ruth: Of course, her parents are never going to let her have an abortion, so that's it for her, game over.
Debbie: and the shame for them, him being a pastor and everything. Word is, he will have to give up being a pastor as he didn't bring his kids up right.  So they are going to be out of the house they have, he isn't really trained for anything else, it's a complete disaster.
Ruth: Bloody hell, I feel bad for them. Can't the church help them out a bit? Its not very Christian, is it, just chucking him out.
Debbie: I agree. They say he has brought scandal but they are the ones who are making this a scandal.
Ruth: Silly girl, though. She's caused no end of trouble. Who's the father anyway?
Debbie: You know Trevor. She has been seeing him for a while. Only in secret as her dad wouldn't let her go out with anyone.
Ruth: Is he standing by her?
Debbie: Yes, he wants to do the decent thing and he says he wants to marry her, but his family are all upset because he was supposed to be going to Uni and now he won't be able to. He will have to start work. His dad will give him a role in his buidling firm as an apprentice.
Ruth: It is a waste of his career.
Debbie: Some people say he is lucky. Abigail is a very nice girl, they clearly do love each other, and he was going to do a useless degree on history and now he will learn to build houses and end up with no student debts and probably as rich as his own dad in ten years from now.
Ruth: Really? So Abigail probably made a logical move then.
Debbie: I doubt she was thinking with her brain, but in fact it should be ok  for her. Its her family and her old man not having a job because of it which is the one to be pitied, I suppose.
Ruth: Maybe Trevor's dad will be able to give Abigail's Dad a job as well?
Debbie: Her mother earns quite well as a bookkeeper, so maybe they will be OK, but it is sad that he won't be able to work at his calling any more.
Ruth: They should just send him to be pastor in a new place, where nobody will hear of this.

Brittany: uhh, yeah, are you kidding me? It's literally been 4 days. 
Gaby: Yeah, I know, but I thought maybe we could talk about it. 
Brittany: I don't know what you want me to say. I mean I'm still pretty torn about it. I don't really feel like talking
Gaby: You know, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to find out like that. 
Brittany: Gee, thanks. Doesn't really make it any easier. 
Gaby: Well I thought maybe if we had talked about it before, it could have been easier. 
Brittany: you know, honestly, I feel stupid. I should have known. You guys have been doing this to me for a while. So I can't act too surprised.
Gaby: Brit, you know that's not true. Why would you think that?
Brittany: WHY WOULD I THINK THAT? Seriously, Gaby, don't play dumb. 
Gaby: I'm not playing dumb. I just honestly mean I'm sorry. I wanted to apologize. 
Brittany: but I don't want your apology. If you just messaged me to say your stupid sorry, then you said it. Can I help you with anything else
Gaby: please don't be like this. we can't do this over facebook. Can we meet to talk?
Brittany: No, I really don't want to. 
Gaby: I really think talking in person would help.
Brittany: I don't really have anything else to say. I gotta go now. Bye. "

Rachel: Hello Donna! Long time no See! How's my favourite cousin!?
Donna: Not sure, haven't seen Wendy since Christmas.
Rachel: Very funny! How did Oliver get on?
Donna: Well, quite well, I think. He had 5 A levels, 4 A*s and 1 A.
Rachel: Quite well!? That’s fanfuckingtastic!!! You've obviously got the brains on your side of the family!
Donna: Thanks! Well, what about Jay?
Rachel: 3 Bs, he's over the moon! He's got into his course and all set to be off!
Donna: Russell Group, is it?
Rachel: What, sorry?
Donna: I mean, I assume, he's got into a Russell Group university, I mean the others are ok, but really, you know, not that good!
Rachel: I honestly don't know. He got the grades, was accepted and he's going. Simple as. We're all very proud of him, actually. He's saving up for a car now.
Donna: Well, as long as you're all happy with it, that's fine. We can't all be high fliers.
Rachel: Now, hang on a sec, Donna. You're my cousin and we've always got on well, but I'm not going to put my son down and ruin his happiness just because he didn't get bleeding A* grades! 
Donna: No, of course. I'm sure you've been as supportive as you are able to be. I believe in really pushing children to achieve.
Rachel: God, you are really something, Donna! Jay is a happy, confident boy and I leave him to his own devices because I trust him!
Donna: Well, Oliver has downloaded his reading list already and is working through them. The competition to stand out in law is fierce. A little encouragement wouldn't go amiss for Jay.
Rachel: Ok, I've had enough of this conversation! Jay is well adjusted and people like him. That's more than I can say for Oliver!
Donna: Well, we'll see about that in 5 years time when Oliver is earning 6 figures and Jay is still scraping a living doing his weird so-called art!
Rachel: Bye Donna, I think you've said quite enough!"

Right now, I'm trying to sort things out in my life, so we'll see how that goes :P How about you? I know you're resting from the surgery, but have you had a chance to meet up with old friends? 🙂
Laura: I do! Polly and Ruthie and we’ve just moved house so I get to meet new friends too
Angela: Awww say hello to the girls from me. And - you moved house? (Just you, or your family?)
Laura: Dad got a new job so it’s the family really - just into Yorkshire🙂 of course I’ll say hi to them!
Angela: Oh cool! I mean, assuming you're happy to go... Where in Yorkshire?🙂
Laura: Ripon- it’s very near Harrogate - or about an hour from York
Angela: I'm asking because my friend from Italy recently moved to York (Erasmus program) and I know it's a weird request, but I was wondering if eventually you could meet. I know it's kinda a huge favour that I'm asking - I just thought that it might be nice for her to have someone to talk to, even if you're not exactly in the same place...)
Laura: I would love to! But I know no Italian ... is she at Uni?
Angela: She speaks English (trust me, I know evry little Italian too)
Laura: Haha!
Angela: She's apparently going to the University of York
Laura: Is she there now?
Angela: I think so - she wrote about two weeks ago that she was moving. One sec - I'll check 
Angela: Oh - she's moving tomorrow :P So, what do you say? If I let her know and you just happen to be in York some time doing business, you could meet?
Laura: I would adore that! Is she nice?
Angela: She's very nice :D (She's my friend! Of course she's nice!)
Laura: Hahah! Of course! Silly question really... I’m 100% up to meet her
Angela: Okay, I'll let her know :D And thank you - it would mean the world to me to know that she has someone who has her back
Laura: Is she nervous?
Angela: Yeah - she's worried about her written English. I told her to read as much as she can 🙂
Laura: If she would like to practice with me I’d be happy to help!
Angela: Awww Laura - you're amazing! Her name is Caterina and she's pretty cool
Laura: Thank you!
Angela: We were roommates for a week (a running joke between us was how her half of the room would spill onto my side :P)
Laura: You’re wonderfully *Wonderful
Angela: I try ;) I also tried to teach her some english phrases like: thing-majig
Laura: Beautiful English!
Angela: I know! Comes in handy during conversations like: ""Where's my thingmajig?"" ""Oh, it's under the couch next to the thingy"" :D I also taught her ""weird"" and ""bizarre"" (they're great words :P)
Laura: They are fabulous words. I like flannel

John: Oh yes, the parents-in-law holiday visit, lovely! Don't worry lad, we've got revision stuff all prepped from last year, you should have been sent the file by Brian or Hilary.
Al: Oh, I'll dig it out, (if it's there!) and have a read over it next week.
John: Oh shit, I remember Romeo isn't on there, we didn't do it last year, someone's going to have to write up some sheets for it! I'll mention it to Hilary tomorrow in the staff meeting.
Al: Should I offer to do it?
John: Yeah, if you're up for it! It'll earn you some Brownie points with Hilary and Senior staff when it comes to renewing your contract. 
Al: OK, then, I'll tell her tomorrow at the meeting.
John: Good idea, I haven't got your youthful energy!
Al: Well, I really need to be kept on, we want to start trying for a baby soon!
John: Are you nuts!? No, seriously, you definitely need to be in a secure job first.
Al: When will they decide about my contract, John?
John: After Easter I should think. I'll put a word in, of course, as I'm your line manager.
Al: You're a pal, John, thanks! 
John: Better get back to marking Of Mice and Men, then, the excitement might kill me, though!
Al: I've been running through the themes with my middle group, they are not exactly bright sparks, are they?
John: Had then last year, they may surprise you come exam time, mind! They don't say a lot, but some of their work is promising.
Al: Hmm, maybe, anyway, see you at the meeting first thing!

Louise: What has Lara done now! Just teen hijinx, is it!?
Sue: No, indeed! It started off ok as we booked the village hall for the right day and almost everyone she invited was able to come. 
Louise: Yes, it's unusual to get teenagers to reply to invitations! Did you stay for the night?
Sue: No, she begged us not to come! We set everything up, decs, drinks etc, nice buffet, but then we made ourselves scarce, we only live on the next street, you see. We decided to pop back in a few hours. That was very naive of us, to be honest!
Louise: I'm guessing things didn't actually go smoothly!
Sue: Understatement of the year! Pete went back round about 11.00 and there was utter carnage! There was vomit and spilled drinks everywhere, the front window had been smashed, the bathroom door had come off it's hinges and the mother and toddler toys and books were ripped and strewn about all over the place. Pete roared at Lara and turned the music off. Nobody moved at first, but he threatened to call the police!
Louise: Wow! I wasn't expecting that! I bet she was thoroughly embarrassed.
Sue: No, not really. About 8 of her friends were sleeping at our house, so they all crashed back there sheepishly.
Louise: Yes, but next day, she must have apologised to you.
Sue: She did not! In fact, around 6 of the group came back to the Hall to help clean up, but Lara refused to get out of bed!
Louise: I can't believe she acted so selfishly! 
Sue: We've made her pay for the damage out of her part time job at the vets and also refused to pay for one of her holidays. 
Louise: Yes, you did right! So she's got more than one holiday?

Louise: So sorry you've had to go through this, Lara needs to step up here, though!
Sue: I know, I think she'll come round. I have a feeling someone sneaked some drugs in and it made a few of them go apeshit! Hope Lara didn't have any.
Louise: I'm sure things will improve. Come and see us all next weekend. Lara loves to see Steve, he's like her little brother.

Frank: And the actors are so damn good... Hey, you know what?
Pete: Yeah?
Frank: The reason why Mahershala Ali is a great actor
Pete: Tell me
Frank: If you look at his face in TD and then in any other movie he's starred in he looks like an entirely different person
Pete: Why?
Frank: Well, here he looks extremely serious and dedicated, while anywhere else he looks like a witty smart ass, maybe a con artist or a pimp XD

Pete: Dorff is also really great
Frank: Yeah, both of them and all the other actors as well, it's a great season
Pete: Also the writing is great

13716576,"Brian: Hello everyone! What has been your favourite moment of the ceremony so far?
Storm: Just joined. I'm enjoying the speech by President Marcon. I pray ppl in my country are listening. I hope our current ruler is listening. We are on very thin ice over here in the US. I don't think ppl truly understand the value of the past.
Patte: Macron's speech (and I am not a particular fan of his)
Laura: Brian the musical performances.
Denis: The view from the Arc down the Champs. Seeing the lettering on the monument, and the students reading the letters of soldiers.
Angie: Brian when he said nationalism was the opposite of patriotism. So true and I wish others would realize it.
Anne: ""Nationalism is the betrayal of patriotism "" Macron, 11/11/2018 Love it!
Margaret: My daughter went to a local fair in Sydney today and all the hundreds attending fell silent at 11am. Very moving!
Denis:  Its a Beautiful moment in the history of the world
Jan: Unfortunate that when a letter by Remarque was being read in German, both CNN and BBC reporters starting talking about something else.
Laura: I am so sorry for every Country's loss of friends, family, neighbors and Citizens. So many attending are emotional. My heart and prayers go out to all of them.😪
Tom: in fact African leaders shouldn't have been invited because they have failed Africa and the world as a whole
Patte: Tom you don't understand the global capital. Europe is a partner to the demise of Africa. African leaders have colluded with global capital. go read up on Togo politics.
Destiny: There's no single benefit after war, Sincere peace is the ultimate. Therefore I urge the whole world to embrace peace.
Angie: Agree!
Larry: War is what comes when people give up on peaceful solutions . Ideas are what keep us from war. Love and Trust are always better than Fear and Doubt.
Larry:  Today is Veterans Day in the US.  We honor everyone’s service to their respective countries 
Peter:  What about the killings that are happening right now because of you and your allies, around the world or the middle east to be precise.
Kafuka: exactly my thoughts.
Larry: The United States has always tried to be peaceful and honorable. Are we perfect? No! But at least we try. We never asked for 911.

Larry: I see. Did you have fun though?
Diane: Yeah it was great. The weather turned out to be awesome so we ended up just goofing off in the pool. 
Larry: Sounds fun! I wish we had a pool.
Diane: Yeah, tbh it's just a hole in your pocket most the time. We literally use it a few times a year.
Larry: Really?! Why? I wouldn't leave it in the summer!
Diane: Idk why. Seems like a good idea in theory... you still gotta pay maintenance every month... we just had to shell out 500 bucks for new pool cleaner.because it randomly decided to stop working.

Larry: Sure you can find someone on fb, try some local groups, people offer all sort of services all the time.

Tina: My daughter Laura and her hubby are coming down from Jo'burg, so I guess we'll have a grand Christmas meal. Bill loves preparing all these English things and Laura is quite mad about them too. I'll bake a proper south African sugarcane cake.
Ella: Never tried this one!
Tina: It's really a joke, more of a traditional name than anything. And too sweet to be enjoyed. Just a Xmas treat. Did you have traditional dishes in Poland, the ones your mother used to prepare for Christmas?
Ella: Oh yes, plenty! But I liked only few of them. I wish I could taste them again though. :( weep,weep..
Tina: Good old days of childhood... When I think about Howick in the days of my childhood and how it has changed for worse, it makes me cringe. Good that my mother didn't live long enough to experience all this deterioration. No good thoughts for Xmas.

13611629,"Kevin: Sorry, I couldn't talk, I had a driving lesson.
Henry: Ahh, wait, you still take them?! I thought maybe you blew them off after driving like Michael Schumacher in Italy.
Kevin: No, I still need to improve my skills a bit to feel safer and more confident. Are you in Paris? Is Paris burning?
Henry: Yes :D I arrived and saw a room and am not sure about it.
Kevin: Oh
Henry: This is why I wanted to ask you.
Kevin: Why?
Henry: for life advice!
Kevin: tell me
Henry: It's an OK-ish room, but a bit dark with window to a courtyard. In winter it can be a bit depressing.
Kevin: Light is important. Is it expensive?
Henry: Paris is super expensive. Usually you pay 800 euro for a room, this one is 400 only.
Kevin: Any other problems with the room?
Henry: Yes, I have to go outside the apartment to get to the toilette.
Kevin: Oh, this is literally pretty shitty. But for this price...
Henry: I think the question is: Am I still a student looking for a good deal and a quick solution? Or am I a serious person, wanting a serious room, even if a little bit more expensive and difficult. 
Kevin: Is the location at least good?
Henry: It is not in the city centre, but OK. It is the area I can expect, I mean more central is really unrealistic. 
Kevin: I would see some other options before the final decision. You have just arrived, after all.
Henry: You are right. I am just so lazy. But you are very right, unfortunately. "

Ben: Seems like someone's been there..
Roger: ahaah nah but some friends went there and that was their description of the place :p
Ben: Sounds like I should really go then ehehe. If you wanna join me I haven't talked with anyone else about it yet 💪
Roger: Oh yeah! Exactly my plan, it's been ages since our last trip say whaaaaat.
Ben: ahahahah getting excited about this! I'll call you later so we can talk better about it alright?
